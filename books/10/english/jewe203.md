Let’s now read the story of a bus conductor and his passengers Understand
with a dog. The story is written by A.G Gardiner.

All about a Dog
embittered
It was a bitterly cold night, and even at the far end of the bus the
evidently
east wind that raved along the street cut like a knife. The bus
malice
stopped and two women and a man got in together and filled the
vacant places. The young woman was dressed in sealskin, and
carried one of those little Pekinese dogs that women in sealskin
like to carry in their laps. The conductor came in and took the
fares. Then his eyes rested with old malice on the beady eyed
toy dog. I saw trouble brewing. This was the opportunity for
which he had been waiting and he intended to make the most
of it. I had marked him as the type of what Mr. Wells has called
the Resentful Employee, the man with a great vague grievance
against everything and a particular grievance against passengers
who came and sat in his seat while he shivered at the door.
“You must take that dog out,” he said with sour venom.
“I shall certainly do nothing of the kind. You can take my
name and address,” said the woman, who had evidently expected
the challenge and knew the reply.
“You must take the dog out— that’s my orders.”
“I won’t go on the top in such weather. It would kill me,” said
the woman.
“Certainly not,” said her lady companion, “You’ve got a cough
as it is.”
“It’s nonsense,” said her male companion.

The conductor pulled the bell and the bus stopped. “This bus
doesn’t go until that dog is brought out.” And he stepped on to
the pavement and waited. It was his moment of triumph. He had
the law on his side and the whole bus full of angry people under
the harrow. His embittered soul was having a real holiday.
The storm inside rose high “Shameful!” “He’s no better than
a German.” “Why isn’t he in the army?” “Call the police. Let’s all
report him.” “Let’s make him give us our fares back.” Everybody
was on the side of the lady and the dog.
That little animal sat blinking at the dim lights in happy
unconsciousness of the rumpus of which he was the cause.
Look Up
and The conductor came to the door, “What’s your number?” said
Understand
one, taking out a pocket-book with a gesture of terrible things.
“There’s my number,” said the conductor imperturbably. “Give
avalanche us our fares back.” “You can’t leave us here all night.” “No fares
back,” said the conductor.
imperiously
Two or three passengers got out and disappeared into the
imperturbably
night. The conductor took another turn on the pavement, then
indignant went and had a talk with the driver. Another bus, the last on
the road, sailed by indifferent to the shouts of the passengers to
quarterdeck
stop, “They stick by each other the villains,” was the comment.
Someone pulled the bell violently. That brought the driver
round to the door, “Who’s conductor of this bus?” he said and
paused for reply. “None coming,” he returned to his seat, and
resumed beating his arms across his chest. There was no hope
in that quarter. A policeman strolled up and looked in at the
door. An avalanche of indignant protests and appeals burst on
him. “Well, he’s got his rules, you know,” he said. “Give your
name and address.” “That’s what he’s been offered, and he won’t
take it.” “Oh,” said the policeman, and he went away and took
his stand a few yards down the street, where he was joined by
two more constables.
And still the little dog blinked at the lights, and the conductor
walked to and fro on the pavement, like a captain on the
quarterdeck in the hour of victory. A young woman, whose voice
had risen high above the gale inside, descended on him with an
air of threatening and slaughter. He was immovable as cold as
the night, and as hard as the pavement. She passed on in a fury
of impotence to the three policemen, who stood like a group of
statuary on the street watching the drama. Then she came back,

imperiously beckoned to her ‘young man’ who had sat a silent
witness of her rage, and vanished. Others followed. The bus was
emptying. Even the dashing young fellow who had demanded the
number and who had declared he would see this thing through
if he sat there all night, had taken an opportunity to slip away.
Meanwhile the Pekinese party was passing through every
stage as of resistance to abject surrender. “I’ll go on the top.”
said the sealskin lady at last. “You mustn’t.” “I will.” “You’ll have
pneumonia.”
“Let me take it.” (This from the man) “Certainly not.” She
would die with her dog. When she had disappeared up the stairs,
the conductor came back, pulled the bell, and the bus went on.
He stood sourly triumphant while his conduct was savagely
discussed in his face by the remnant of the party.
Then the engine struck work, and the conductor went to help
the driver. It was a long job and presently the lady with the dog
stole down the stairs and re-entered the bus. When the engine
was put right, the conductor came back and pulled the bell.
Then his eyes fell on the dog, and his hand went to the bell-rope
again. The driver looked around, the conductor pointed to the
dog, the bus stopped, and the struggle recommenced with all
the original features — the conductor walking the pavement, the
driver smacking his arms on the box, the little dog blinking at
the lights, the sealskin lady declaring that she would not go on
the top and finally going.
“I’ve got my rules,” said the conductor to me when I was the
last passenger left behind. He had won his victory, but felt that
he would like to justify himself to somebody. “Rules,” I said,“
are necessary things, but there are rules and rules. Some are
hard and fast rules, like the rules of the road, which cannot be
broken without danger to life and limb. But some are only rules
for guidance, which you can apply or wink at, as common sense
dictates, like that rule about the dogs. They are not a whip, put
in your hand to scourge your passengers with, but an authority
for an emergency. They are meant to be observed in the spirit,
not in the letter, for the comfort and not the discomfort of the
passengers. You have kept the rule and broken its spirit. You
may mix your rules with a little goodwill and good temper.” He
took it very well and when I got off the bus he said “Good night”
quite amiably.

A. Phrasal verbs
The sentence below is taken from the text you have read.
The phrase in italic is a phrasal verb. A phrasal verb is a

check in or a verb + an adverb, for example break down).
When they are used together, they usually take on a different
meaning to that of the original verb.

B. The Passive
Compare the two sentences given below:
Ramesh painted the walls.
The walls were painted by Ramesh.
The first sentence is in active form and the second
sentence is in passive form. When the person doing the action
(Ramesh) is the subject, we use the verb in the active voice.
When the subject is what the action is directed at (the walls),
we use the verb in the passive voice. In the first sentence, we
talked about Ramesh but in the second sentence we talked
about what happened to the walls.
In the passive sentence we use by+agent to add important
information, that is by Ramesh. We can leave out by+agent if
it does not provide any specific information.
Example:
All the students were given sweets yesterday.
My room is cleaned everyday in the morning.
A large number of films on wildlife conservation have been made.
Use the words given below and frame sentences using
the passive forms of the verbs.
Examples:
• Rice / cultivate / Gangetic valley and coastal region.
(Simple Present)
Rice is cultivated in Gangetic valley and coastal region.
• The documents / sign / principal. (Present Perfect)
The documents have been signed by the principal.
(a) Taj Mahal / build / Shah Jahan. (Simple Past)
