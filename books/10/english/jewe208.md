Let’s Begin
1. In the lesson ‘The Sermon at Benaras’ you were asked to find
out the meaning of ‘sermon’. The meanings are given below
but these are in different contexts:
• a talk on a religious or moral subject
• a long or monotonous piece of admonition or caution or a
warning, a lecture.
(a) Discuss with your classmates the context to which the
present text belongs.
(b) What could be the examples for the different context
according to you?
(c) When your parents or elders say something, you say,
“Oh, not again!” When do you say so and why?
2. Read the poem given below in the context of ‘The Sermon at
Benaras’. It was actually delivered as a part of a sermon in
1910 by the author, Canon Henry Scott Holland (1847 — 1918),
a priest at St. Paul’s Cathedral, London. After reading the
poem, discuss in groups of four and list the similarities and
differences between ‘The Sermon at Benaras’ and ‘Death Is
Nothing At All’. For example the theme, the situation, the
philosophy of the two speakers etc.
Death Is Nothing At All
Death is nothing at all.
It does not count.
I have only slipped away into the next room.
Nothing has happened.

Reported Speech
We use direct speech when we repeat someone’s words and
indirect speech when we use our own words to report what
someone else has said. We use an appropriate reporting verb,
make pronominal (relating to pronouns) changes and change
certain words denoting ‘nearness’ in the direct form to words
suggesting ‘remoteness’ (in time and place) in the indirect form.

Use the reporting verbs given above whereever necessary.
You can use any other reporting verb you find suitable.
It is said, “It is not how much we have, but how much we
enjoy that makes happiness.”
Being happy does not require everything to be good but an
eye to see good in everything. One day a crow saw a swan.
“This swan is so white,” he thought, “and I am so black. This
swan must be the happiest bird in the world.”
The swan replied, “I was feeling that I was the happiest
bird around. But I think the parrot is the happiest bird as it
has two colours.” The crow then approached the parrot. The
parrot said, “I have only two colours, but the peacock has
multiple colours.”
The crow then visited a peacock in the zoo. “Dear peacock,”
the crow said, “you are so beautiful. Every day, thousands
of people come to see you. You are the happiest bird on the
planet.”
The peacock said, “I always thought that I was the most
beautiful and happy bird on the planet. But I am entrapped
in this zoo. I have realised that the crow is the only bird not
kept in a cage, and could happily roam everywhere.”

1. Following is a narrative on Sanchi stupa. Listen to it carefully
and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the
recorded narrative or ask your teacher, sibling or friend to
read it aloud.
The fascinating and world
famous Sanchi stupa is
located on a hilltop in
Sanchi town, Madhya
Pradesh, India. It is one
of the most important
Buddhist monuments
that portrays Buddhist
art and sculpture.
Starting from the third
century BC through the
twelfth century AD, it
attracts the attention of thousands of visitors round the year
including national and foreign tourists, archaeologists, and
historians among others.
This stupa is the oldest stone structure in India that was
built during the Mauryan period. Originally commissioned
in the third century BCE by Emperor Ashoka, this huge
hemispherical dome consists of a central chamber. In this
chamber, the relics of Lord Buddha are placed. The original
construction work of this stupa was supervised by Ashoka.
His wife, Devi, was the daughter of a merchant of nearby
village, Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the
venue of her and Ashoka’s wedding. Later, four ornamental
gateways or toranas facing four directions and a balustrade
surrounding the stupa were added in the first century
BCE. The Great stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone
structures in India and counted among the best conserved
ancient stupas of Central India. It has been enlisted as an
UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989.

It is important to know that everyone has some problem or other,
and they grieve in unique ways. Your grief is different than those
around you. You have experienced a loss or an intense sorrow,
especially caused by someone’s death. This can also refer to the
loss of physical or cognitive abilities or the loss of something that
was routine in your life such as friendship, head boy or head girl,
playing for school, etc.
Discuss with your friend and note down—
• what could be the possible reasons for someone’s grief or
sorrow.
• how can they overcome this.
Share your feelings and suggestions in the class.

grief. You may consider the following points:
• grief is expressed through a variety of behaviours —
observe these
• reach out to others in their grief, but some people may
not want to accept help; some will not share their grief —
understand this
• some others will want to talk about their thoughts and
feelings — be a support to them, stand by them
• let the grieving person know you care for them — be
patient
• focus on what you can do, like holding their hand, etc. — a
solace or a consolation
