Baby Bhakat
Hi! My name is Bhakat. I am a baby Civet cat. I
am three month old. Shhh! I am taking a nap with
my brothers. Yes, I live in a family of humans.
They treat me like their own Baby!
My home is a little thatched hut by a river in
a small village in Assam. The hut has an earthen
floor and mud-splattered walls. Its doors are
always open. I come and go as I please! Mama
takes care of all three of us! Her name is Anjali.
She cooks, cleans and plays with me. I secretly
think she loves me the most. She lets me be real
naughty!
Mama is about to make brunch! She is making
roti and vegetables. I don’t like vegetables, but I
like fruits. I love meat. I am omnivorous. Mama
always feeds me before anyone else! I love things
dipped in milk. They are yummy!
The man of the house is Dharini. If not for him, I
would not be alive today! My civet mother built a
nest for me in a very tall coconut tree. One night
I slipped and fell to the ground! When villagers
found me they took me to Dharini. Dharini loves
animals. I began to live in his home. I was very small. I could not
walk. I ate and slept a lot!
Do you know why my eyes are so large? That’s because I am
a nocturnal animal. I sleep in the day and am active in the night.
My large eyes help me see better in the dark! I also have a very
long tail! It helps me balance on tree-tops and branches. I mostly
live on trees, though I do come down to the ground. Animals like
me are called arboreal!
Inside Dharini’s house, I always snooze in the rafters. I like
being high up; it reminds me of trees! One day I woke up to find
a strange sight, Dharini’s house was filling with water! In the
night, the river behind the house started overflowing its banks!
Inside everything was helter-skelter. Things were piled on top of
one another! The monsoon had arrived!
Dharini and Anjali carried us babies outside the house! There
was water everywhere and it was very muddy! But the sun was
out and it was not raining! I stayed high on the fence and made
sure even my long tail did not get wet! Dharini went to pick snails.

Snails had climbed branches and walls to escape drowning in
the flood! Every gardener knows that snails eat plants. By eating
snails, I ensure that they do not overrun your garden. I maintain
the balance of life in nature!
When it floods, you find fish everywhere! Dharini cast his net
in the garden and began catching fishes. They are kept in a pan
of water to keep them alive and fresh to eat!
Montu, my brother, tried to be naughty! He caught me and
threatened to dip me in water! He got a scolding from Dharini.
I hate to be in water! Back inside the house, it is time for me
to play with Mama! I shall rest awhile and then be up again at
night. Mama always leaves a midnight snack by the lantern!

It’s not easy having Elephants in your backyard.
Around the world, as communities expand, and natural wild
places are reduced, people and wildlife are increasingly coming
into conflict over living space and food.
It might be baboons in Namibia attacking young goats or Look Up

Human-wildlife conflict is happening more and more, affecting a

How we are tackling human-wildlife conflict
The solutions are often specific to the wildlife or area concerned,
and are often creative and simple — for instance planting a barrier
of crops that repel the animals (elephants and some other wildlife
don’t like chilli, for example).
An important aspect of the work is that it benefits both the
animals and local people and actively involves the communities
concerned (in the case of chilli, it can be sold to increase income).
It’s about finding solutions that lead to mutually beneficial
coexistence.
The work has also often led to people being more enthusiastic
and supportive of conservation, and has demonstrated that
people can live alongside wildlife while developing sustainable
livelihoods.

Animal rights
People who support animal rights recognise that all animals
have an inherent worth, a value completely separate from their
usefulness to humans. Every being with a will to live has the
Look Up
and
right to live free from exploitation and suffering.
Understand
All animals have the ability to suffer in the same way and to
the same degree that humans do. They feel pain, pleasure, fear,
frustration, loneliness, and familial love. Whenever we consider consideration
doing something that would interfere with their needs, we are

morally obligated to take them into account.
People often ask if animal rights mean that animals should familial
have the right to vote or drive a car. Of course, that would be
inherent
silly because those aren’t rights that would benefit animals. But
animals have the right not to suffer at the hands of humans and
to live their lives free from suffering and exploitation because
they have an interest in doing so. That is the difference between
equal consideration and equal treatment.
Almost everyone cares about animals in some context, whether
it’s a beloved family companion, an irresistibly cute kitten or a
majestic wild animal seen in a documentary. After all, we each
have some built-in capacity for empathy and compassion, as can

and
Understand Logically and morally, there is no reason to differentiate in
the way we treat the animals we share our homes with and those
who are farmed for food. They are all individuals, with the same

capacity to feel pain and fear. Animal rights help us to look past
compassion the arbitrary distinctions between different species, to rediscover
our innate compassion, and to respect all animals equally.
documentary
Anyone who cares about animals can start putting these
empathy principles into practice every single day with the food they eat,
the clothes they wear, and the products they buy. These choices
are a form of non-violent protest that makes a real difference
both by reducing the profits of corporations that harm or kill
animals and by creating a growing market for cruelty-free food,
fashion, services, and entertainment.

the village could swim around him. He had never harmed or
attacked anyone. He was not a crocodile but a friend and a
divine creature for them, who was worshipped in this village.
Some say that he would even eat rice and dal which was served
by the villagers and kids. He was very understanding and if he
saw anyone swimming near him, he used to go to the other
side of the pond. Villagers used to identify themselves with the
crocodile as people used to call this village — Magarmachha
vala gaaon, the Crocodile’s village. In fact, the villagers now
wish to build a statue of Gangaram near the pond to remember
their friend, who got the village a new name. It may be weird,
but it could be an example of how humans and animals can
coexist without harming each other.
