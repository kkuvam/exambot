Sardar Patel’s Call to Youth to build
Character and be Disciplined
I must thank you for the affectionate and warm welcome which
you have extended to me and for the love and regard which you

have shown me by conferring this honour to me. Gifts are of
many kinds those achieved by one’s own endeavour are good
and deserved, but no gift should be conferred on one whose
worthiness has not been tested. By selecting me without assuring
yourself of my fitness for the gift, you have laid me under a heavy
debt and, by your injunctions that I should continue to prove
worthy of it throughout my life, you have imposed on me a very
difficult obligation. At present, I cannot say anything because I
am bound by your love and affection; and, therefore, with your
blessing and God’s grace, I pray that I may prove worthy of it.
Should I fail, the blame for my failure will be shared by you
as well.
On this occasion, I wish to place before you a few
thoughts which occur to my mind as incidental to our
hard-won freedom. We have now won our freedom. But
just as I am doubtful, if I deserved the honour that
you have done me, you have also to think whether you
have done everything to deserve freedom that you have
attained after such a bitter and sustained struggle.
There are people who think that having won freedom,
there is nothing more to do about it. Freedom has come
to us through sacrifices. Those who made sacrifices
tasted the fruit of their efforts and self-denials, but it is for
those who are now enjoying freedom to taste its fruit. After
the last World War, there is an all-round deterioration in
human standards. People have become self-centered. They
have forgotten or ignored the wider interests of the country.
The essential and noteworthy features of our struggle were:
sacrifice, truth, and non-violence. The weapons of the
World War were: violence, brute force, political and
military moves, and counter moves. As a result of
the churning of the ocean, the world has emitted
poison. That poison is spreading all over and
there is none to swallow it. The countries which
were free have managed to digest it somewhat, but we, who have
just attained our freedom, it is hard to do the same. Therefore,
those who think that having attained freedom they have attained
everything have really attained nothing! The freedom that we
have won is yet to be consolidated. The foundations of freedom
have to be well and truly laid! This one-year old child has to be
nursed and nourished, instructed and strengthened. It is for us
to do it and we must do it.

In India today, there is no time for useless controversies and
unnecessary debates and disputes. One can indulge in these
pastimes when one has time and leisure. At present, we have
to occupy ourselves with the all absorbing task of making the
foundation of our freedom strong and unassailable. We have to
reflect on our place in this broken and destructed world and what Look Up
our duty and obligations are! If we fail to make the best use of and

obligation
and to those citizens of tomorrow that we have yet to stand on
our feet. We must concentrate on one thing alone, viz., how to precincts
make our country strong and united. We can make it strong
unassailable
when hearts are pure and when we fully appreciate our duty.
Now that foreign rulers have gone, are we in a position to sustain
the whole burden that has devolved on us? When we took over
from them, the administrative fabric was in tatters. We have
to mend and place it. This, in itself, is a heavy responsibility.
It is for our universities to train young men to shoulder these
responsibilities.
The great university of life is full of experiences, but to make
full use of those experiences, all of us students, teachers and
professors — have to be cautious and on guard.
The most essential requisite is character. If your character is
lacking and you leave the precincts of the alma mater without
your character fully developed, you will be wasting an opportunity
of a lifetime.
You have to realise that India has to attain its rightful place
in the comity of nations. The leadership of Asia would be hers
if she conducts herself well and if her citizens make their fitting
contribution to nation’s resurgence. Whatever trials and troubles
we might have passed through, there is no denying the fact
that we have a precious inheritance and the teachings we have
received from the departed leaders are great assets for us.
India abounds in the resources of nature and manpower. They
are awaiting full use. That task must devolve on young men and
women. We ourselves were trained in the school of experience.
We fought for freedom and we have attained that prize for you. It
is now up to you to prove yourself worthy of the same. This you
can do only if you work with single-minded devotion to the cause
of the country. It is only then that you can deserve this freedom
and be proud of it.
