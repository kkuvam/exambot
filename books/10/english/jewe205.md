Let’s Begin
In the ‘Glimpses of India’ (First Flight, Class X textbook, NCERT)
you have read about interesting people and places. India is a
place of diversity in terms of culture, language, food, traditions,
etc. There are many stories unknown to us about the way of life
of people. Work in groups of four and find out about the following
in any five Indian states.
• Their regional cuisine
• Dance form and music
• Art form
• Any other information
Mark these five places on a map and represent the information
highlighting the interesting facts.

The following is an excerpt about the Parsi community in India
and their food.
Read the passage and answer the questions.
“Aavoji, aavo, aavo! Welcome to Delhi! Let me show you my
beautiful city.” The booming voice of Nowrosji Kapadia could
be heard across the length and breadth of the platform. It was
Nowrosji’s favourite pastime: a walk to the Old Delhi railway
station to greet the Frontier Mail as it chugged into Delhi from
Mumbai to Peshawar. With this refrain, an eager Nowrosji would
cajole Parsi visitors off the train and take them home for a meal
and often persuade some to stay overnight or for a few days. He

would use this opportunity to tell them about the advantages

of shifting to Delhi. Though his wife Jer Bai would occasionally
and
Understand object to unknown visitors, she was always overruled. This was
the beginning of the community of Parsis in Delhi....
...Writing about Parsis in the Delhi of old is not easy. There are
cajole
memories of my grandparents and parents — a collective memory
dainty of generations past and people long gone, yet here in spirit....
During festive gatherings, the women went to town with the
extensive
food; outside catering was unheard of. The poorer members of
overruled
the community never knew who had paid for what. This tradition
vouch continued in the northern cities of Lucknow, Kanpur, and
Allahabad well into the ‘70s. Sadly, that kind of life has almost
gone forever.
Food preparations began two days in advance. Dar ni pori (rich
pastry stuffed with sweetened lentils) and malido (halwa) were
carried in big vatus (pots) and served with puris. Anyone who has
made malido can vouch for the fact that you need strong biceps;
it is an exhausting exercise. The first time I made it under my
grandmother’s supervision was also the last. I could hardly move
my arms for the next two days! Since then, I gained a healthy
respect for my dainty grandmother.
The menu was extensive. Breakfast would start with either
sev—brown vermicelli cooked in milk and served with fresh
cream—or ravo, semolina pudding, Mithu dahi or sweetened
curd made with full cream milk was an absolute must. This was
followed by bafellaeeda, hard-boiled eggs, and kheemo kaleji,
mutton mince with liver. For lunch, there was almost always
smori dal chawal and macchi no patio — white boiled rice with
yellow dal offset by a tart and tangy fish curry.
Teatime was special at our home. My grandmother made it
a point to dress for tea; I was made to do the same. Once we
were ready, out came the treats: Parsi biscuits — batasa, nan-
khatai and flaky khari; patrel, rolled, steamed arbi leaves stuffed
with besan masala; kumas, rich Parsi cake; and my favourite,
bhakra, sweet deep fried doughnuts. That tradition has stayed
with me. I certainly don’t dress up, but I still need a snack with
at least three cups of tea!...

You have read about Coorg, its rainforests, and coffee and tea
from Assam in ‘Glimpses of India’ (First Flight, Class X textbook,

in Araku valley in Andhra Pradesh. The story of Araku Valley

The journey of Araku Coffee from a livelihood initiative by the tucked
Naandi Foundation to a globally appreciated product has been
in the making for over a decade. It is also intrinsically tied to the
history of how coffee arrived in this valley. It was a British civil
servant, N.S. Brodie, who introduced coffee to these hill tracts
in 1898.

Today, Araku coffee is a brand that works with 517 villages and
10,986 farmers, all of whom are estate owners and entrepreneurs
with a stake in the business. The reason the coffee is of such high
quality is that it follows the best practices of bio-dynamic farming
by creating an interconnected and symbiotic ecosystem. The soil
is enriched through composting and a variety of shade trees
are planted, including cash-yielding fruit trees like mango and
jackfruit. Terroirs are assessed and careful standard operating
procedures are put in place from “sapling to savouring”, which
ensures healthier plants and sweeter cherries and eventually a
far superior coffee aroma and flavour.

below. Correct the words and read the paragraph aloud.
The Valley of Flowers
The journey to the Valley of Flowers begins about 16 km away
from Joshimath, at Govindghat (1,770 m) on the Rishikesh-
Badrinath heightway. The Valley of Flowers is covered with a
rich varity of magnifiscent plants.
Over the past few years, thousand of visitors have ‘discovered’
this idyll amidst the mountain. However, they live like marks
only by way of empty cans, waste-paper and cigarete butts.
Trakking in the area has resulted in the trampling of these
delikate plants by humans and ponies. As a result, the
government of India was compeled to ban all mountainering,
trekking, expeditions and livestock grasing in the area, with
effect from February 20, 1983. This is to privent further
damage to one of our nation’s unique repositories of natural
beauty.

During our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be our friend,
F
acts
companion and guide. He used to come at least twice a day.
Once, when he set out in the morning on his selling round,
and then again, when he returned after emptying his huge Adverse — difficult
basket. The jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from Averse — strong
sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was it so? Was feelings against
it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The loaves were bought
by some Paskine or Bastine, the maid-servant of the house!
What we longed for were those bread-bangles which we chose
carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of a special kind.
The baker made his musical entry on the scene with
the ‘jhang, jhang — sound of his specially made bamboo
staff. One hand supported the basket on his head and the
other banged the bamboo on the ground. He would greet the
lady of the house with a “Good morning” and then place his
basket on the vertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed
aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered
to the servant. But we would not give up. We would climb a
bench or the parapet and peep into the basket, somehow. I
can still recall the typical fragrance of those loaves; loaves for
the elders and the bangles for the children. Then we did not
even care to brush our teeth or wash our mouths properly.
And why should we? Who would take the trouble of plucking
the mango leaf for the toothbrush? And why was it necessary
at all? The tiger never brushed his teeth. Hot tea could wash
and clean up everything so nicely, after all!
Now summarise the paragraph using your notes.
