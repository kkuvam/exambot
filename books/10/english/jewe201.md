Given below is a story of the tailor who has been known for his
skills in cheating and stealing. Read in groups of four or in pairs.
You may discuss the events and incidences of the story with
your friends and write them in a sequential manner.
The Trader and the Tailor
Look Up
There was a tailor who was known for beating others in the art of
and
being light-fingered and thievery. A trader swore that even with

thread from him without his knowledge.
beguiling
The trader was told that many others, more intelligent than
cordiality him, had been beaten by the tailor. They said he should not
imagine himself so great, for his ego would only give him worse
hamper
troubles in competition with the tailor. Still, the trader became
snipping
more competitive and made a wager that the tailor would not be
wagered able to rob him of anything.
He wagered an Arab horse with those who taunted him. If
the tailor failed to steal, then they would have to give him a
horse instead. That night, the trader lay awake troubled by the
situation and could not sleep a wink.
In the morning, he put a piece of satin cloth under his arm
and went to the bazaar and entered the shop and saluted the
cunning rogue warmly. The tailor sprang up from his seat and
welcomed the trader, inquiring about his health with cordiality
exceeding even that of the trader, planting in his heart great
feelings of affection for him. When the trader heard these songs
of sweetness from the tailor, he flung down the piece of silk
saying, “Cut this into a coat for me and make it wide below my
navel so as not to hamper my legs and tight about it to show off
my figure.”
The tailor answered, “O! kindly man, I will do you a hundred
services,” and accepted the order. He measured the satin and
inspected the working surface and all the time chatted away
to the trader in idle gossip, about other amirs and of bounties
and gifts he had received from them, and about misers and their
mean ways, and made the trader laugh with hysterics. During
this beguiling talk, he was snipping away with his scissors
rapidly, cutting as fast as his lips moved.

The trader was laughing, the tailor was cutting, the trader

closed his eyes in joy, the tailor cut extra pieces, tucking them
and
under his thighs, hidden away from all but God. From his delight Understand
at the tailor’s tales, the trader’s former boast went out of his
mind. What satin? What boast? What wager? The trader was
filching
drunk on the jokes told by the tailor.
Then the tailor told such an incredible story that the trader incredible
fell over on his back with laughter. The tailor swiftly stitched a
swatch
swatch of the satin to the hem of his underpants while the trader
unhinged
was paying no attention at all, greedily sucking with every guffaw
at the jests the tailor told. The tailor continued to tell funnier and
funnier tales and jokes until the trader was completely within
his power.
With his eyes shut and his reason vanished, the bewildered
and boastful trader was drunk with joy. And the tailor continued
to cut, filching yet more of the beautiful cloth, with nothing to
stop him now. And yet the trader begged for more.
You who becomes the slave of the jest, no story is more
laughable than you yourself, think on this at the edge of
your grave. How long will you listen to the lies of this world
that leave your mind and spirit unhinged? The Universal
Tailor will cut and stitch the hems of a hundred travellers,
silly as children.
Eventually the tailor became bored with the whole story and
told the trader that he better leave before another tale was told,
“For if I tell another one, the coat will be too tight for you, and
you will stop laughing and weep tears of blood.”

1. Lencho, the main character in the story, is a farmer.
He supports his family through farming. The conflict in
the story happens when a hailstorm strikes the field and
destroys his farm. All the hard work, for nothing! The entire
land is wrecked by catastrophe. There is no one who can
help. Lencho’s complete faith in God is amazing during the
calamity.
So, one type of conflict dominating in the story is man
versus nature. Discuss with your partner the natural calamities
that play havoc in the lives of people. Collect photographs and
make a visual presentation to share in the class.
2. Try writing a small poem on the topic man versus nature.
Read aloud the poem with the required stress and intonation.
Given below is a poem written by Norman Littleford, which
may help you think and compose.

Man vs Nature
The heavens roared with thunder
as lightning filled the skies
was this God getting angry
or Nature’s big surprise.
Is Mother Nature telling us
the best way that she can
to stop the interference
and abuse she gets from man.
We marvel at her beauty
each time we look around
then dig up all her treasures
from their natural burial ground.
We forget that Nature gives us
all that keeps us living
we take it all and still want more
but never think of giving.
We build across the countryside
progressing every day
but Mother Nature can’t progress
for man is in the way.

1. You may have come across some people in your
neighbourhood who might have inspired you with their
actions. Talk to them about—
• their childhood, their education, job, their likes and
dislikes
• their contribution to the enrichment of their village or
town, job, country, etc.
• their interesting features and characteristics
Request for their pictures. Based on the collected information,
write their portraits and present it to the class. You may
read on ‘How to do project work?’ given below.
How to do project work in the English
language classroom?
In addition to the textbook activities, project work could be
used as an effective strategy to promote collaborative ways of
language learning where we work together in groups to do an
activity. We collect information, ideas; observe the language
being used; use language in real life situations; exchange
views and debate on ideas; write the ideas into a report; edit
our writing and produce the report in a suitable form. This
helps in constructing ideas and analysing critical judgments
of the peers to arrive at a decision or conclusion.
It would be of much benefit to learners, if projects planned
are of an interdisciplinary nature.
Designing and managing projects
There are many ways students can be initiated to carry out
projects.
• Read books, newspapers, listen to the radio, watch
TV, consult websites and encyclopedia, talk to people,
observe events and proceedings, interview people,
record audio/ video, collect pictures and illustrations,
interpret them, and report.
• Write field notes to remember and organise the data
collected.

• Bring your own ideas to the class and have a class
discussion.
• Use language meaningfully and precisely. If the meaning
of learning is ‘meaning making’, the purpose is achieved
fully while doing projects.
• Learners should do the projects in group independently.
They should not ask their parents to do these or buy
readymade products available in the market.
• They may seek information or some help from parents
or elders.
Planning, writing the draft and editing
Having collected the required data, information and ideas,
plan and organise the data and interpret them to write the
draft. It could be posters, a script of a play (enact and direct
a play), songs, essays, etc. Editing is an important part
of writing the report. Students should be made aware of
process approach involved in writing a good piece of work.
