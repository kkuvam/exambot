Let’s Begin
The World Wars fought in the past stand testimony to the fact
that fighting wars brings severe human suffering. The sufferers,
including women and children are left behind with trauma and
indelible impressions on their minds. You have read in the
Class X English textbook the account of one such war in the
diary of Anne Frank who captured the miseries of war in her
diary. Discuss how you may relate to Anne Frank’s feelings of
alienation and isolation.

The following excerpt is from the diary of Lena Mukhina, a
teenage girl who had undergone the atrocities of Germans when
they fortified the city of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad is
an important landmark in the history of Russia. The siege of

off from the rest of Russia. The Germans continuously bombarded

air raids and artillery bombardment of residential
neighbourhoods drove the city’s inhabitants into
bomb shelters, several times a day, and for hours at
a time. People’s initial curiosity in the aftermath
of the first bomb attacks soon gave way to fear
and then, in conditions of appalling hunger
and cold, to apathy. Leningraders welcomed
inclement weather for the reduced visibility
it brought. They came to dread sunny days
and moonlit nights, when the Germans
would be sure to bomb their city. Cloud
cover, however, offered no protection
from artillery fire: in just over six
months from the start of the siege there
were only thirty-two days when shells
did not explode on the city’s streets.
Lena Mukhina Hunger soon set in. Between September
and November 1941 the bread rations that had been announced
in July were reduced five times, reaching their lowest point on 20
November — 125 ‘blockade grams’ for children, dependents and
white-collar workers and 250g for manual workers, technicians
and engineers. Rations of meat, butter, sugar and other food
items were severely reduced. The summer months and the
beginning of autumn, when it was still possible to buy food
without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no
more than a distant memory.

There are many ways of recording the events, news, and
personal experiences. Diary writing, logbook, daybook, journal,
etc. are a few to name. The journal writing is about writing the
everyday record of an event or writing about an event, activity
or experience, etc.
The following is an excerpt from the beginning of A Journal of
the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe.
A Journal of the Plague Year
Look Up It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among
and the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that
Understand
the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very
violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in
discourse
the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from
inspection Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods which were
brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought
plague
from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it
tokens came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.
We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days
vent
to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them
by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practiced since.
But such things as these were gathered from the letters of
merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them
were handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not
spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.
But it seems that the Government had a true account of it,
and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming
over; but all was kept very private. Hence, it was that this rumour
died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were
very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till
the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664
when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long
Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they
were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as
it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood,
the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning
themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth,
two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house

of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave
their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon,
it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to

One of the three islands in the Juan Fernandez archipelago,
700 km off the Pacific coast of Chile was discovered in the
16th century. Alexander Selkirk, the Scottish sailor was
marooned there for four years and four months. He related his
experience to Daniel Defoe, who wrote his famous adventure
book Robinson Crusoe based on the sailor’s experience, since
then the island is known as Robinson Crusoe.
There is a seemingly unbelievable true story of the orphaned
bear cub, which was found by Polish troops during World
War II who travelled with them through Iraq, Syria, Palestine,
Egypt, Italy and Scotland. During the war, Wojciech Narebski
and his fellow Polish servicemen had to lift crates of heavy
metal artillery. Fortunately for them, one of the soldiers had
superhuman strength: Corporal Wojtek, a Syrian brown bear.
When the bear saw that soldiers were struggling, he’d want to
help... he’d come over, grab a crate and carry it to the truck.
This can be heavy work, even for a bear. When Wojtek (bear)
got tired, he would simply stack one crate on top of the other
which also helped the soldiers because they didn’t have to lift
the crate off the ground. Of course, Corporal Wojtek (bear) got
a reward of honey and marmalade. That was his favourite!
You know, things can happen that you wouldn’t normally
think are true. Collect some more stories under the title—
‘Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.’
