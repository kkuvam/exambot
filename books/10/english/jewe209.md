Let’s Begin
1. Facial expressions are non-verbal communications. These
expressions play an important role in a play. They are
powerful communication tools. The human face is extremely
expressive. It is able to convey countless emotions without
saying a word. Expressions tell us the mood of the characters
in the play. Some facial expressions are given below. The
facial expressions are for happiness, sadness, anger,
surprise, fear, and disgust. Look at the facial expressions
and write which emotion do they express.

2. You have read ‘The Proposal’, a one act play. It is a farce.
The play is set in only one location, the drawing room of
Chubukov’s house. All three characters in the play are
quarrelsome people and they quarrel over petty issues.
Lomov and Natalya start with the issue like a piece of land
that is situated at the border between the two neighbors’
properties. The discussion turns into a quarrel and the
marriage proposal is forgotten. They shout at each other.
They are again dragged into an argument over the superiority
of each other’s dogs. So, they drag their ancestors in their
foolish quarrel. They again abuse each other and call
names.
Now, make groups of four and discuss the following
points. While conducting the discussion, try to use the facial
expressions given above.
• The marriage proposal is a mockery of romance and
marriage in the upper class.
• The pride in property, even the superiority of dogs, take
priority over love and marriage.
• The characters lack patience, stop listening to each other,
and then contradict each other.
• Do you think these quarrels will promise a happy life?
• What qualities would you consider for a well-matched
couple?
• Do you think all of us should know how to manage our
anger?

How Can We Control Anger?
Do you get angry when your mother switches off the television?
Do you get upset when you lose a game? Do you crib when your
teacher does not pay attention to you? Most of us can have “yes”
as an answer to one or more of these situations. Anger sometimes
gets the better of us and leaves us to regret the consequences
later. The question is ‘How can we control anger?’
Anger is a normal and healthy emotion only if we know how
to respond to it. Uncontrolled anger can often harm us directly or

the issue, let us revisit the concept of anger. Anger is nothing but
absence of peace with oneself, people or situations around us.

Understand Let us all become the managers of our own anger. When angry,
take a few moments to calm down (take five deep breaths, count
up to ten, drink water, change your place) before responding.

faces at the mirror, etc., go a long way in helping us let go of the
distress anger or the frustration inside us. Once we have our feelings
under control, go through all the aspects of the situation and
grudge
try to see the same situation from different perspectives. If it is a
uncontrolled
problem try to equip yourself with a few solutions before entering
the same situation. Avoid holding a grudge with people and learn
when to seek help from others. Realising your own shortcomings
can become one of the greatest strengths of character over the
years to come.
We can never control circumstances, people or situations as
they are constantly changing. The only thing we can control is
our response. So we have to increase our capacity to tolerate,
ability to understand, and learn to nurture love for others.

On Violence
There is a great deal of violence in the world. There is physical
violence and also inward violence. Physical violence is to kill
another, to hurt other people consciously, deliberately or without
thought, to say cruel things, full of antagonism and hate and
inwardly, inside the skin, to dislike people, to hate people, to
criticise people. Inwardly, we are always quarrelling, battling, not
only with others, but with ourselves. We want people to change,
Look Up
we want to force them to our way of thinking.
and
In the world, as we grow up, we see a great deal of violence, at Understand
all levels of human existence. The ultimate violence is war — the
killing for ideas, for so-called religious principles, for nationalities,
antagonism
the killing to preserve a little piece of land. To do that, man will
consciously
kill, destroy, maim, and also be killed himself. There is enormous

inherent in you. And education is supposed to help you to go
beyond all that, not merely to pass an examination and get a job.
You have to be educated so that you become a really beautiful,
healthy, sane, rational human being, not a brutal man with a
very clever brain who can argue and defend his brutality. You

You have to create a new culture. A new culture cannot be
exploded
based on violence. The new culture depends on you because the
vaporised older generation has built a society based on violence, based on
aggressiveness and it is this that has caused all the confusion,
all the misery. The older generations have produced this world
and you have to change it. You cannot just sit back and say, “I
will follow the rest of the people and seek success and position.”
If you do, your children are going to suffer. You may have a
good time, but your children are going to pay for it. So, you
have to take all that into account, the outward cruelty of man to
man in the name of god, in the name of religion, in the name of
self-importance, in the name of the security of the family. You
will have to consider the outward cruelty and violence, and the
inward violence which you do not yet know.

(Vanka Zhukov, a nine-year old boy, was made an assistant acts
to Alyakhin, the Shoemaker. He didn’t go to bed on Christmas
Eve. When everyone in the shop had gone to Church, he began Silent
to write on a crumpled sheet of paper. “Dear Grandfather letter: B
Konstantin, he wrote”, I’m writing a letter to you. I wish you Lamb
a Merry Christmas and all good things from the Lord God. Climb
I’ve no father and mother, and you are all I have left.”) Bomb
Vanka raised his eyes to the dark windowpane. In his
imagination he saw his grandfather Konstantin standing
there. His grandfather was a night watchman on the estate of
a rich man. Konstantin was a small, thin and lively old man
of sixty-five whose face was always crinkling with laughter.
In the daytime the old man slept in the servant’s kitchen
or cracked jokes with the cooks. At night, wrapped in a big
sheepskin coat he made rounds of the estate, blowing his
whistle at regular intervals. He was always followed by his
dogs, Brownie and Eel. Eel was a particularly remarkable
dog. He was extremely respectful and endearing and looked
lovingly on friends and strangers alike; yet no one trusted
him. He would creep behind someone and bite his leg or run
off with a peasant’s chicken. Many a time Eel was beaten
mercilessly, yet he always managed to survive.
At this very moment, Vanka thought, grandfather was
probably standing by the gates, looking up at the bright red
windows of the village church and cracking jokes with the
servants.
“What about a pinch of snuff?” he would say, holding out
his snuffbox to the women.
The women would take a pinch and sneeze and the old
man would feel happy about it. “Fine for frozen noses, eh!”
he’d say.
The dogs, too, were given snuff. Brownie would sneeze,
shake her head and walk away looking hurt. Eel, too polite
to sneeze, only wagged his tail.
Vanka looked through the window. The weather was
glorious. The air was fresh. The night was very dark, but the
roofs of the houses and trees were all covered with snow.

Stars twinkled in the sky and it appeared that they had been
washed and placed there only for the holidays.
Vanka sighed, and went on writing: “Yesterday I was given
a beating. That was because when I was rocking the baby
in the cradle, I unfortunately fell asleep. Another day the
mistress of the house asked me to clean the fish. I didn’t

“I’ll grind your snuff for you, he went on”, I’ll pray to God
to keep you healthy and if I ever do anything wrong, you
can beat me as you like. If you think there’s no place for
me then I can clean boots or even work as a shepherd boy.
Grandfather, it’s more than I can bear. I thought of running
away to the village, but I don’t have any boots. If you’ll help
me now, I’ll feed you when I grow up and when you die I’ll
pray for your soul just like I do for my mother.
“Dear Grandfather, when they put up the Christmas tree
at the big house, please take down a golden walnut for me
and hide it in the green box. Ask the young mistress Olga,
and say it is for Vanka.”
Vanka sighed and gazed in the direction of the window.
He remembered it was grandfather who always went to the
forest to cut down a Christmas tree for the rich people, taking
Vanka with him. They had a wonderful time together, the
snow falling, the trees crackling and hares springing across
the trees,
When the tree had been chopped down, grandfather would
drag it to the big house and they would start decorating it.
The young mistress Olga, Vanka’s favourite, was the busiest
of all. Vanka’s mother, when alive, had worked as Olga’s
maid. Then Olga had given him all the sweets and played
a lot with Vanka. But after his mother’s death, Vanka was
sent to the kitchen to be with his grandfather and from there
to Alyakhin, the shoemaker.

“Come to me, dear grandfather,” Vanka wrote on, “Please,
take me away from here, have pity on me, a poor orphan. They
are always beating me. I’m terribly hungry and so miserable
that I’m always crying. Remember me to all my friends. I
remain your grandson, Ivan Zhukov. Dear grandfather,
please come soon.”
Vanka folded the sheet of paper and then put it in an
envelope he had bought the previous day. He thought for a
while, then wrote the address: To Grandfather in the Village.
He added the words: Konstantin Makarich. He was happy
that no one had disturbed him while he was writing his letter.
He ran out to the street to post it. Vanka had been told by
the clerks that letter were dropped in boxes from where they
were carried all over the world on mail coaches drawn by
horse and driven by drunken drivers, while the bells jingled.
Vanka ran to the nearest mailbox and put his letter in it.
An hour later, lulled by sweetest hopes, he was fast asleep.
He dreamed of a stove. His grandfather was sitting beside it,
reading out his letter to the cooks. Eel, the dog, was walking
round the stove, wagging his tail.
