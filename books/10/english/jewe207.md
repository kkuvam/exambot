Let’s Begin
1. In the story ‘Madam Rides the Bus’, Valli took a bus ride on
the bus that she wanted to for last several months. She knew
that she had to buy tickets for this. So she saved money
suppressing all temptation to buy things like peppermints,
toys, balloons, etc., and paid for the ticket.
• What all exciting things did she see from the bus?
• Was the excitement the same on her return journey?
Discuss with your classmate and write a paragraph based on

Read the passage given below
and answer the questions that
follow.
Vishav Driman (65 year old) and her
husband Kamal Jeet (69 year old) set out to discover
the hidden treasure of Uttarakhand by bicycle. Vishav
shares their post-retirement adventure.
Pedalling through the Golden Years
At a time when our peers were slowing down, relaxing
and watching sunsets from their front porch, we found a
new passion — cycling. We started out with short
daily rides, but found ourselves looking forward
to them more and more, so much that we decided
to venture further and cover more ground. There
were obvious health concerns — the risk of
performing a physically strenuous activity at a
high altitude, the most obvious of them. But
it helped that we had lived in Uttarakhand’s
capital, Dehradun, our entire lives, and were
therefore acclimatised to the cold winds and
narrow winding roads that characterise this
beautiful state. We were also familiar with almost all
the scenic mountain trails it had to offer.
Short rides extended to longer ones as we started falling deeper
Look Up in love with not just the sport, but the very idea of discovering
and a world we had always been a part of, but never had the time to

explore. Soon, a simple hobby turned into a project of sorts, and
we started participating in cyclotrons and other cycling events
acclimatised being held in the city. Admiration and encouragement poured
in from family members, friends and neighbours along the way,
cyclotrons
sparking a new thought — was it possible to travel across the
extended
state on our bicycles? It seemed daunting at first, but we knew
strenuous we had to try. Our gear in place, our bikes serviced, and our
minds set, we set off on an adventure we would remember for
venture
the rest of our lives.

In my opinion, there are very few ways to
enjoy and appreciate the beauty of Uttarakhand
and cycling is the most thrilling of them all.
Sunlight filtering through the trees and a cool
breeze gently caressing your faces as you ride,
coupled with breathtaking views of sal forests
spread like a green cover on the mountains
and surrounding valleys, the experience of
pedalling across the state is truly inexplicable.
Of the many trails we navigated, there is one
that occupies a special place in our hearts. It
began from Ghanta Ghar, a popular tourist
attraction in Dehradun, it took us through
some of the most picturesque locations of the state such as
Kimadi, Hathi Paon, Mussoorie and Chaar Dukaan, right up to
George Everest point. This 100km ride (approximately) is also
one of the few routes in Uttarakhand that encapsulates all the
element that one expects while cycling here — steep slopes, sharp
curves, endless hills, lush forests, and off-road experiences.

Makes the lungs laugh, the throat cry:—
“O bird, see; see, bird, I fly.
“Is this, is this your joy?
O bird, then I, though a boy,
For a golden moment share
Your feathery life in air!”
Say, heart, is there aught like this
In a world that is full of bliss?
‘Tis more than skating, bound
Steel-shod to the level ground.
Speed slackens now, I float
Awhile in my airy boat;
Till, when the wheels scarce crawl,
My feet to the treadles fall.
Alas, that the longest hill
Must end in a vale; but still,
Who climbs with toil, wheresoe’er,
Shall find wings waiting there.

The eastern region of India is no doubt charmingly novel in
many of its features. Mizoram, literally the land of Mizos is an
expanse of blue-green hills. Mizoram is broken up lenghwise
into five major mountain ranges gradually descending from
the south to the north. The hills are rugged and their heights
uneven. The name of the state Mizoram is made of two words.
‘Mi’ means human beings, ‘Zo’ means a hill. So, a ‘Mizo’ is a
human dweller of a hill; Mizoram means the land of the hill-
dwellers. Aizawl is the capital town of the State built in tiers
along the hill.
The Mizos have three main festivals — Mim Kut, Chapchar
Kut and Pawl Kut. These festivals are associated with their
agricultural activities during which they enjoy life by singing
and dancing. The Mizos, blessed as they are with a beautiful
environment and rich culture, are a vibrant and social people.
They love to dance as much as they love to sing. They boast
a number of folk and community dances handed down from
one generation to the other through the ages. The dances are
expressions of the gay, carefree spirit of the Mizos. It should
be noted here that these dances are not intended for stage
performance, rather they have been evolved for community
involvement and participation.

1. Read Part II of the story ‘Madam Rides the Bus’. There
are many conversations between Valli, the conductor, and
some elderly people in the bus. Convert the conversations
into dialogues between the characters. Many words like
commandingly, haughtily, loudly (shouted), smilingly,
irritably, curtly etc. have been used in this part. These are the
different ways in which the characters have spoken. These
show the mood, emotion, and intention of the characters.
Now, write the dialogues and then in groups of three, enact
it as a skit in the class.
It was a fine spring afternoon. The bus was just on the verge
of leaving the village. Valli, a small eight year old girl, wanted
to go on a bus ride.
Valli (loudly): Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
Conductor (without looking up): Who is it? Hurry then!
Valli (loudly): It’s me, I am the one who has to get on the bus.
Conductor (smilingly): Oh. really! _________________________

When you travel by a bike, Vishav says that the frame and
tyres of the bike should be according to the rider’s height.
One should carry a hand pump, extra tubes, and a puncture
kit for emergency situations. Right accessories such as
sweat-resistant gloves, helmets, knee and elbow pads, and a
pair of shoes is of utmost importance. It is also necessary to
carry essentials like dry food, water, and Oral Rehydration
Salts (ORS). A first-aid kit with pain killers, muscle relaxing
balms, and band-aids are also advisable.
Now, prepare a list of things that you would like to suggest
to people who want to travel by:
