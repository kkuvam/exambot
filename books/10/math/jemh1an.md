19. 16 rows, 5 logs are placed in the top row. By putting S = 200, a = 20, d = –1 in the formula
n
S = [2a + (n −1)d], we get, 41n – n2 = 400. On solving, n = 16, 25. Therefore, the
2
number of rows is either 16 or 25. a = a + 24 d = – 4
25
i.e., number of logs in 25th row is – 4 which is not possible. Therefore n = 25 is not
possible. For n = 16, a = 5. Therefore, there are 16 rows and 5 logs placed in the top

25. (i) Incorrect. We can classify the outcomes like this but they are not then ‘equally
likely’. Reason is that ‘one of each’ can result in two ways — from a head on first
coin and tail on the second coin or from a tail on the first coin and head on the
second coin. This makes it twicely as likely as two heads (or two tails).
(ii) Correct. The two outcomes considered in the question are equally likely.

4. y = 7 5. ∠ A = 100°, ∠ C = 100°, ∠ D = 180°
6. PQRS is a rectangle.
7. Yes, because of the premise. No, because 3721 = 61 which is not irrational. Since the
premise was wrong, the conclusion is false.
