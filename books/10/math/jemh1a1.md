ROOFS IN ATHEMATICS
A1.1 Introduction
The ability to reason and think clearly is extremely useful in our daily life. For example,
suppose a politician tells you, ‘If you are interested in a clean government, then you
should vote for me.’ What he actually wants you to believe is that if you do not vote for
him, then you may not get a clean government. Similarly, if an advertisement tells you,
‘The intelligent wear XYZ shoes’, what the company wants you to conclude is that if
you do not wear XYZ shoes, then you are not intelligent enough. You can yourself
observe that both the above statements may mislead the general public. So, if we
understand the process of reasoning correctly, we do not fall into such traps
unknowingly.
The correct use of reasoning is at the core of mathematics, especially in constructing
proofs. In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of proofs, and you actually proved
many statements, especially in geometry. Recall that a proof is made up of several
mathematical statements, each of which is logically deduced from a previous statement
in the proof, or from a theorem proved earlier, or an axiom, or the hypotheses. The
main tool, we use in constructing a proof, is the process of deductive reasoning.
We start the study of this chapter with a review of what a mathematical statement
is. Then, we proceed to sharpen our skills in deductive reasoning using several examples.
We shall also deal with the concept of negation and finding the negation of a given
statement. Then, we discuss what it means to find the converse of a given statement.
Finally, we review the ingredients of a proof learnt in Class IX by analysing the proofs
of several theorems. Here, we also discuss the idea of proof by contradiction, which
you have come across in Class IX and many other chapters of this book.
A1.2 Mathematical Statements Revisited
Recall, that a ‘statement’ is a meaningful sentence which is not an order, or an
exclamation or a question. For example, ‘Which two teams are playing in the

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 219
Cricket World Cup Final?’ is a question, not a statement. ‘Go and finish your homework’
is an order, not a statement. ‘What a fantastic goal!’ is an exclamation, not a statement.
Remember, in general, statements can be one of the following:
 always true
 always false
 ambiguous
In Class IX, you have also studied that in mathematics, a statement is
acceptable only if it is either always true or always false. So, ambiguous sentences
are not considered as mathematical statements.
Let us review our understanding with a few examples.
Example 1 : State whether the following statements are always true, always false or
ambiguous. Justify your answers.
(i) The Sun orbits the Earth.
(ii) Vehicles have four wheels.
(iii) The speed of light is approximately 3 × 105 km/s.
(iv) A road to Kolkata will be closed from November to March.
(v) All humans are mortal.
Solution :
(i) This statement is always false, since astronomers have established that the Earth
orbits the Sun.
(ii) This statement is ambiguous, because we cannot decide if it is always true or
always false. This depends on what the vehicle is — vehicles can have 2, 3, 4, 6,
10, etc., wheels.
(iii) This statement is always true, as verified by physicists.
(iv) This statement is ambiguous, because it is not clear which road is being referred
to.
(v) This statement is always true, since every human being has to die some time.
Example 2 : State whether the following statements are true or false, and justify your
answers.
(i) All equilateral triangles are isosceles.
(ii) Some isosceles triangles are equilateral.
(iii) All isosceles triangles are equilateral.
(iv) Some rational numbers are integers.

(v) Some rational numbers are not integers.
(vi) Not all integers are rational.
(vii) Between any two rational numbers there is no rational number.
Solution :
(i) This statement is true, because equilateral triangles have equal sides, and therefore
are isosceles.
(ii) This statement is true, because those isosceles triangles whose base angles are
60° are equilateral.
(iii) This statement is false. Give a counter-example for it.

(iv) This statement is true, since rational numbers of the form , where p is an

p
(v) This statement is true, because rational numbers of the form , p, q are integers

(vi) This statement is the same as saying ‘there is an integer which is not a rational
number’. This is false, because all integers are rational numbers.
(vii) This statement is false. As you know, between any two rational numbers r and s
r s
lies , which is a rational number.

Example 3 : If x < 4, which of the following statements are true? Justify your answers.
(i) 2x > 8 (ii) 2x < 6 (iii) 2x < 8
Solution :
(i) This statement is false, because, for example, x = 3 < 4 does not satisfy 2x > 8.
(ii) This statement is false, because, for example, x = 3.5 < 4 does not satisfy 2x < 6.
(iii) This statement is true, because it is the same as x < 4.
Example 4 : Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that
they become true statements:
(i) If the diagonals of a quadrilateral are equal, then it is a rectangle.
(ii) A line joining two points on two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side.
(iii) p is irrational for all positive integers p.
(iv) All quadratic equations have two real roots.

Remark : There can be other ways of restating the statements above. For instance,

perfect square’.

true? Justify your answers.
(i) Both a and b must be zero. (ii) Both a and b must be non-zero.
(iii) Either a or b must be non-zero.
4. Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that they become true.
(i) If a2 > b2, then a > b. (ii) If x2 = y2 , then x = y.
(iii) If (x + y)2 = x2 + y2, then x = 0. (iv) The diagonals of a quadrilateral
bisect each other.
A1.3 Deductive Reasoning
In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of deductive reasoning. Here, we will
work with many more examples which will illustrate how deductive reasoning is

used to deduce conclusions from given statements that we assume to be true. The
given statements are called ‘premises’ or ‘hypotheses’. We begin with some examples.
Example 5 : Given that Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka, and suppose Shabana
lives in Bijapur. In which state does Shabana live?
Solution : Here we have two premises:
(i) Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka (ii) Shabana lives in Bijapur
From these premises, we deduce that Shabana lives in the state of Karnataka.
Example 6 : Given that all mathematics textbooks are interesting, and suppose you
are reading a mathematics textbook. What can we conclude about the textbook you
are reading?
Solution : Using the two premises (or hypotheses), we can deduce that you are
reading an interesting textbook.
Example 7 : Given that y = – 6x + 5, and suppose x = 3. What is y?
Solution : Given the two hypotheses, we get y = – 6 (3) + 5 = – 13.
Example 8 : Given that ABCD is a parallelogram,
and suppose AD = 5 cm, AB = 7 cm (see Fig. A1.1).
What can you conclude about the lengths of DC and
BC?
Solution : We are given that ABCD is a parallelogram.
So, we deduce that all the properties that hold for a Fig. A1.1
parallelogram hold for ABCD. Therefore, in particular,
the property that ‘the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal to each other’, holds.
Since we know AD = 5 cm, we can deduce that BC = 5 cm. Similarly, we deduce that
DC = 7 cm.
Remark : In this example, we have seen how we will often need to find out and use
properties hidden in a given premise.
Example 9 : Given that p is irrational for all primes p, and suppose that 19423 is a
prime. What can you conclude about 19423?
Solution : We can conclude that 19423 is irrational.
In the examples above, you might have noticed that we do not know whether the
hypotheses are true or not. We are assuming that they are true, and then applying
deductive reasoning. For instance, in Example 9, we haven’t checked whether 19423

is a prime or not; we assume it to be a prime for the sake of our argument.What we
are trying to emphasise in this section is that given a particular statement, how we use
deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. What really matters here is that we use
the correct process of reasoning, and this process of reasoning does not depend on the
trueness or falsity of the hypotheses. However, it must also be noted that if we start
with an incorrect premise (or hypothesis), we may arrive at a wrong conclusion.
EXERCISE A1.2
1. Given that all women are mortal, and suppose that A is a woman, what can we conclude
about A?
2. Given that the product of two rational numbers is rational, and suppose a and b are
rationals, what can you conclude about ab?
3. Given that the decimal expansion of irrational numbers is non-terminating, non-recurring,
and 17 is irrational, what can we conclude about the decimal expansion
of 17?
4. Given that y = x2 + 6 and x = – 1, what can we conclude about the value of y?
5. Given that ABCD is a parallelogram and  B = 80°. What can you conclude about the
other angles of the parallelogram?
6. Given that PQRS is a cyclic quadrilateral and also its diagonals bisect each other. What
can you conclude about the quadrilateral?
7. Given that p is irrational for all primes p and also suppose that 3721 is a prime. Can
you conclude that 3721 is an irrational number? Is your conclusion correct? Why or
why not?
A1.4 Conjectures, Theorems, Proofs and Mathematical Reasoning
Consider the Fig. A1.2. The first circle
has one point on it, the second two points,
the third three, and so on. All possible
lines connecting the points are drawn in
each case.
The lines divide the circle into
mutually exclusive regions (having no
common portion). We can count these
and tabulate our results as shown :

Some of you might have come up with a formula predicting the number of regions
given the number of points. From Class IX, you may remember that this intelligent
guess is called a ‘conjecture’.
Suppose your conjecture is that given ‘n’ points on a circle, there are 2n – 1
mutually exclusive regions, created by joining the points with all possible lines. This
seems an extremely sensible guess, and one can check that if n = 5, we do get 16
regions. So, having verified this formula for 5 points, are you satisfied that for any n
points there are 2n – 1 regions? If so, how would you respond, if someone asked you,
how you can be sure about this for n = 25, say? To deal with such questions, you
would need a proof which shows beyond doubt that this result is true, or a counter-
example to show that this result fails for some ‘n’. Actually, if you are patient and try
it out for n = 6, you will find that there are 31 regions, and for n = 7 there are 57
regions. So, n = 6, is a counter-example to the conjecture above. This demonstrates
the power of a counter-example. You may recall that in the Class IX we discussed
that to disprove a statement, it is enough to come up with a single counter-
example.
You may have noticed that we insisted on a proof regarding the number
of regions in spite of verifying the result for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Let us consider
a few more examples. You are familiar with the following result (given in Chapter 5):
n(n1)
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = . To establish its validity, it is not enough to verify the
2
result for n = 1, 2, 3, and so on, because there may be some ‘n’ for which this result is
not true (just as in the example above, the result failed for n = 6). What we need is a
proof which establishes its truth beyond doubt. You shall learn a proof for the same in
higher classes.

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 225
Now, consider Fig. A1.3, where PQ and PR
are tangents to the circle drawn from P.
You have proved that PQ = PR (Theorem 10.2).
You were not satisfied by only drawing several such
figures, measuring the lengths of the respective
tangents, and verifying for yourselves that the result
Fig. A1.3
was true in each case.
Do you remember what did the proof consist of ? It consisted of a sequence of
statements (called valid arguments), each following from the earlier statements in
the proof, or from previously proved (and known) results independent from the result
to be proved, or from axioms, or from definitions, or from the assumptions you had
made. And you concluded your proof with the statement PQ = PR, i.e., the statement
you wanted to prove. This is the way any proof is constructed.
We shall now look at some examples and theorems and analyse their proofs to
help us in getting a better understanding of how they are constructed.
We begin by using the so-called ‘direct’ or ‘deductive’ method of proof. In this
method, we make several statements. Each is based on previous statements. If
each statement is logically correct (i.e., a valid argument), it leads to a logically correct
conclusion.

A1.5 Negation of a Statement
In this section, we discuss what it means to ‘negate’ a statement. Before we start, we
would like to introduce some notation, which will make it easy for us to understand
these concepts. To start with, let us look at a statement as a single unit, and give it a
name. For example, we can denote the statement ‘It rained in Delhi on 1 September
2005’ by p. We can also write this by
p: It rained in Delhi on 1 September 2005.
Similarly, let us write
q: All teachers are female.
r: Mike’s dog has a black tail.
s: 2 + 2 = 4.
t: Triangle ABC is equilateral.
This notation now helps us to discuss properties of statements, and also to see
how we can combine them. In the beginning we will be working with what we call
‘simple’ statements, and will then move onto ‘compound’ statements.

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 229
Now consider the following table in which we make a new statement from each
of the given statements.
Original statement New statement
p: It rained in Delhi on ~p: It is false that it rained in Delhi
1 September 2005 on 1 September 2005.
q: All teachers are female. ~ q: It is false that all teachers are
female.
r: Mike’s dog has a black tail. ~r: It is false that Mike’s dog has a
black tail.
s: 2 + 2 = 4. ~s: It is false that 2 + 2 = 4.
t: Triangle ABC is equilateral. ~t: It is false that triangle ABC is
equilateral.
Each new statement in the table is a negation of the corresponding old statement.
That is, ~p, ~q, ~r, ~s and ~t are negations of the statements p, q, r, s and t, respectively.
Here, ~p is read as ‘not p’. The statement ~p negates the assertion that the statement
p makes. Notice that in our usual talk we would simply mean ~p as ‘It did not rain in
Delhi on 1 September 2005.’ However, we need to be careful while doing so. You
might think that one can obtain the negation of a statement by simply inserting the
word ‘not’ in the given statement at a suitable place. While this works in the case of
p, the difficulty comes when we have a statement that begins with ‘all’. Consider, for
example, the statement q: All teachers are female. We said the negation of this statement
is ~q: It is false that all teachers are female. This is the same as the statement ‘There
are some teachers who are males.’ Now let us see what happens if we simply insert
‘not’ in q. We obtain the statement: ‘All teachers are not female’, or we can obtain the
statement: ‘Not all teachers are female.’ The first statement can confuse people. It
could imply (if we lay emphasis on the word ‘All’) that all teachers are male! This is
certainly not the negation of q. However, the second statement gives the meaning of
~q, i.e., that there is at least one teacher who is not a female. So, be careful when
writing the negation of a statement!
So, how do we decide that we have the correct negation? We use the following
criterion.
Let p be a statement and ~p its negation. Then ~p is false whenever p is
true, and ~p is true whenever p is false.

1 September 2005 | ~p: It is false that it rained in Delhi
on 1 September 2005. |
| q: All teachers are female. | ~ q: It is false that all teachers are
female. |
| r: Mike’s dog has a black tail. | ~r: It is false that Mike’s dog has a
black tail. |
| s: 2 + 2 = 4. | ~s: It is false that 2 + 2 = 4. |
| t: Triangle ABC is equilateral. | ~t: It is false that triangle ABC is
equilateral. |

For example, if it is true that Mike’s dog has a black tail, then it is false that
Mike’s dog does not have a black tail. If it is false that ‘Mike’s dog has a black tail’,
then it is true that ‘Mike’s dog does not have a black tail’.
Similarly, the negations for the statements s and t are:
s: 2 + 2 = 4; negation, ~s: 2 + 2  4.
t: Triangle ABC is equilateral; negation, ~t: Triangle ABC is not equilateral.
Now, what is ~(~s)? It would be 2 + 2 = 4, which is s. And what is ~(~t)? This
would be ‘the triangle ABC is equilateral’, i.e., t. In fact, for any statement p, ~(~p)
is p.
Example 12 : State the negations for the following statements:
(i) Mike’s dog does not have a black tail.
(ii) All irrational numbers are real numbers.
(iii) 2 is irrational.
(iv) Some rational numbers are integers.
(v) Not all teachers are males.
(vi) Some horses are not brown.
(vii) There is no real number x, such that x2 = – 1.
Solution :
(i) It is false that Mike’s dog does not have a black tail, i.e., Mike’s dog has a black
tail.
(ii) It is false that all irrational numbers are real numbers, i.e., some (at least one)
irrational numbers are not real numbers. One can also write this as, ‘Not all
irrational numbers are real numbers.’
(iii) It is false that 2 is irrational, i.e., 2 is not irrational.
(iv) It is false that some rational numbers are integers, i.e., no rational number is an

A1.6 Converse of a Statement
We now investigate the notion of the converse of a statement. For this, we need the
notion of a ‘compound’ statement, that is, a statement which is a combination of one or
more ‘simple’ statements. There are many ways of creating compound statements,
but we will focus on those that are created by connecting two simple statements with
the use of the words ‘if’ and ‘then’. For example, the statement ‘If it is raining, then it
is difficult to go on a bicycle’, is made up of two statements:
p: It is raining
q: It is difficult to go on a bicycle.
Using our previous notation we can say: If p, then q. We can also say ‘p implies
q’, and denote it by p  q.
Now, supose you have the statement ‘If the water tank is black, then it contains
potable water.’ This is of the form p  q, where the hypothesis is p (the water tank
is black) and the conclusion is q (the tank contains potable water). Suppose we
interchange the hypothesis and the conclusion, what do we get? We get q  p, i.e., if
the water in the tank is potable, then the tank must be black. This statement is called
the converse of the statement p  q.

In general, the converse of the statement p  q is q  p, where p and q are
statements. Note that p  q and q  p are the converses of each other.
Example 13 : Write the converses of the following statements :
(i) If Jamila is riding a bicycle, then 17 August falls on a Sunday.
(ii) If 17 August is a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle.
(iii) If Pauline is angry, then her face turns red.
(iv) If a person has a degree in education, then she is allowed to teach.
(v) If a person has a viral infection, then he runs a high temperature.
(vi) If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India.
(vii) If triangle ABC is equilateral, then all its interior angles are equal.
(viii) If x is an irrational number, then the decimal expansion of x is non-terminating
non-recurring.
(ix) If x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x), then p(a) = 0.
Solution : Each statement above is of the form p  q. So, to find the converse, we
first identify p and q, and then write q  p.
(i) p: Jamila is riding a bicycle, and q: 17 August falls on a Sunday. Therefore, the
converse is: If 17 August falls on a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle.
(ii) This is the converse of (i). Therefore, its converse is the statement given in
(i) above.
(iii) If Pauline’s face turns red, then she is angry.
(iv) If a person is allowed to teach, then she has a degree in education.
(v) If a person runs a high temperature, then he has a viral infection.
(vi) If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai.
(vii) If all the interior angles of triangle ABC are equal, then it is equilateral.
(viii) If the decimal expansion of x is non-terminating non-recurring, then x is an
irrational number.
(ix) If p(a) = 0, then x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x).
Notice that we have simply written the converse of each of the statements
above without worrying if they are true or false. For example, consider the following
statement: If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India. This statement is true. Now
consider the converse: If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai. This need not be
true always – he could be in any other part of India.

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 233
In mathematics, especially in geometry, you will come across many situations
where p  q is true, and you will have to decide if the converse, i.e., q  p, is also
true.
Example 14 : State the converses of the following statements. In each case, also
decide whether the converse is true or false.
(i) If n is an even integer, then 2n + 1 is an odd integer.
(ii) If the decimal expansion of a real number is terminating, then the number is
rational.
(iii) If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of corresponding
angles is equal.
(iv) If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then the quadrilateral is
a parallelogram.
(v) If two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles are equal.
Solution :
(i) The converse is ‘If 2n + 1 is an odd integer, then n is an even integer.’ This is a
false statement (for example, 15 = 2(7) + 1, and 7 is odd).
(ii) ‘If a real number is rational, then its decimal expansion is terminating’, is the
converse. This is a false statement, because a rational number can also have a
non-terminating recurring decimal expansion.
(iii) The converse is ‘If a transversal intersects two lines in such a way that each
pair of corresponding angles are equal, then the two lines are parallel.’ We have
assumed, by Axiom 6.4 of your Class IX textbook, that this statement is true.
(iv) ‘If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal’,
is the converse. This is true (Theorem 8.1, Class IX).
(v) ‘If the corresponding angles in two triangles are equal, then they are congruent’,
is the converse. This statement is false. We leave it to you to find suitable counter-
examples.

(i) If it is hot in Tokyo, then Sharan sweats a lot.
(ii) If Shalini is hungry, then her stomach grumbles.

2. Write the converses of the following statements. Also, decide in each case whether the
converse is true or false.
(i) If triangle ABC is isosceles, then its base angles are equal.
(ii) If an integer is odd, then its square is an odd integer.
(iii) If x2 = 1, then x = 1.
(iv) If ABCD is a parallelogram, then AC and BD bisect each other.
(v) If a, b and c, are whole numbers, then a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.
(vi) If x and y are two odd numbers, then x + y is an even number.
(vii) If vertices of a parallelogram lie on a circle, then it is a rectangle.
A1.7 Proof by Contradiction
So far, in all our examples, we used direct arguments to establish the truth of the
results. We now explore ‘indirect’ arguments, in particular, a very powerful tool in
mathematics known as ‘proof by contradiction’. We have already used this method in
Chapter 1 to establish the irrationality of several numbers and also in other chapters to
prove some theorems. Here, we do several more examples to illustrate the idea.
Before we proceed, let us explain what a contradiction is. In mathematics, a
contradiction occurs when we get a statement p such that p is true and ~p, its negation,
is also true. For example,
a
p: x , where a and b are coprime.
b
q: 2 divides both ‘a’ and ‘b’.
If we assume that p is true and also manage to show that q is true, then we have
arrived at a contradiction, because q implies that the negation of p is true. If you
remember, this is exactly what happened when we tried to prove that 2 is irrational
(see Chapter 1).
How does proof by contradiction work? Let us see this through a specific example.
Suppose we are given the following :
All women are mortal. A is a woman. Prove that A is mortal.
Even though this is a rather easy example, let us see how we can prove this by
contradiction.
 Let us assume that we want to establish the truth of a statement p (here we
want to show that p : ‘A is mortal’ is true).

## Page 18

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 235
 So, we begin by assuming that the statement is not true, that is, we assume that
the negation of p is true (i.e., A is not mortal).
 We then proceed to carry out a series of logical deductions based on the truth of
the negation of p. (Since A is not mortal, we have a counter-example to the
statement ‘All women are mortal.’ Hence, it is false that all women are mortal.)
 If this leads to a contradiction, then the contradiction arises because of our faulty
assumption that p is not true. (We have a contradiction, since we have shown
that the statement ‘All women are mortal’ and its negation, ‘Not all women are
mortal’ is true at the same time. This contradiction arose, because we assumed
that A is not mortal.)
 Therefore, our assumption is wrong, i.e., p has to be true. (So, A is mortal.)
Let us now look at examples from mathematics.
