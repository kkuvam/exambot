CHAPTER
Metals and Non-metals
In Class IX you have learnt about various elements. You have seen
that elements can be classified as metals or non-metals on the basis of
their properties.
n Think of some uses of metals and non-metals in your daily life.
n What properties did you think of while categorising elements
as metals or non-metals?
n How are these properties related to the uses of these elements?
Let us look at some of these properties in detail.

3.1.1 Metals
The easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their
physical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following
activities. For performing Activities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of
following metals – iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,
zinc and any other metal that is easily available.
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....11111
n Take samples of iron, copper, aluminium and magnesium. Note
the appearance of each sample.
n Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper
and note their appearance again.
Metals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is
called metallic lustre.
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....22222
n Take small pieces of iron, copper, aluminium, and magnesium.
Try to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your
observations.
n Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs.
CAUTION: Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by
pressing between the folds of a filter paper.
n Put it on a watch-glass and try to cut it with a knife.
n What do you observe?

You will find that metals are generally hard. The hardness varies
from metal to metal.
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....33333
n Take pieces of iron, zinc, lead and copper.
n Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five
times with a hammer. What do you observe?
n Repeat with other metals.
n Record the change in the shape of these metals.
You will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This
property is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the
most malleable metals?
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....44444
n List the metals whose wires you have seen in daily life.
The ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility.
Gold is the most ductile metal. You will be surprised to know that a wire
of about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.
It is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be
given different shapes according to our needs.
Can you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels?
Do you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do
the following Activity to find out the answer.
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....55555
n Take an aluminium or copper
wire. Clamp this wire on a
stand, as shown in Fig. 3.1.
n Fix a pin to the free end of the
wire using wax.
n Heat the wire with a spirit lamp,
candle or a burner near the
place where it is clamped.
n What do you observe after some
time?
n Note your observations. Does
the metal wire melt?

and have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and

What happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce conductors of electricity.
a sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface
are said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of
metals?
3.1.2 Non-metals
In the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals
as compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,
sulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either solids
or gases except bromine which is a liquid.
Do non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?
Let us find out.
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....77777
n Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine.
n Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6 with these non-metals
and record your observations.
Compile your observations regarding metals and non-metals in Table 3.1.

On the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the
general physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. You
must have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their
physical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example –
(i) All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature.
In Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting

These two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.
(ii) Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.
(iii) Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each
form is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is
the hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting
and boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a
conductor of electricity.
(iv) Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they
can be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting
points.
Elements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals
on the basis of their chemical properties.

n Take a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder.
n Burn the magnesium ribbon. Collect the ashes formed and dissolve
them in water.
n Test the resultant solution with both red and blue litmus paper.
n Is the product formed on burning magnesium acidic or basic?
n Now burn sulphur powder. Place a test tube over the burning
sulphur to collect the fumes produced.
n Add some water to the above test tube and shake.
n Test this solution with blue and red litmus paper.
n Is the product formed on burning sulphur acidic or basic?
n Can you write equations for these reactions?
Most non-metals produce acidic oxides when dissolve in water. On
the other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. You will be learning
more about these metal oxides in the next section.

3.2.1 What happens when Metals are burnt in Air?
You have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium burns in air with a dazzling
white flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by
performing the following Activity.
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....99999
CAUTION: The following activity needs the teacher’s assistance.
It would be better if students wear eye protection.
n Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try
burning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.
n Collect the product if formed.
n Let the products and the metal surface cool down.
n Which metals burn easily?
n What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?
n How does the metal surface appear after burning?
n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity
towards oxygen.
n Are the products soluble in water?
Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.
Metal + Oxygen → Metal oxide
For example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen
to form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.
2Cu + O → 2CuO
2
(Copper) (Copper(II) oxide)
Similarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.
4Al + 3O → 2Al O
2 2 3
(Aluminium) (Aluminium oxide)
Recall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.
We have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal
oxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as
basic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as
bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.
Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –
Al O + 6HCl → 2AlCl + 3H O
2 3 3 2
Al O + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO + H O
2 3 2 2
(Sodium
aluminate)
Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve
in water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in
water to produce alkalis as follows –
Na O(s) + H O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)
2 2
K O(s) + H O(l) → 2KOH(aq)

We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with
oxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities
towards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so
vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them
and to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.
At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,
aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The
protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron
does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled
in the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is
coated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do
not react with oxygen even at high temperatures.

Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium
develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it
resistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the
oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode
and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode
reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can
be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.
After performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium
is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of
magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.
But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of
zinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a
conclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.
3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with Water?

n Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers
half-filled with hot water.
n For the metals that did not react with hot water, arrange the
apparatus as shown in Fig. 3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.

FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 33333.....33333 Action of steam on a metal
Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen
gas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form
metal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.
Metal + Water → Metal oxide + Hydrogen
Metal oxide+ Water → Metal hydroxide
Metals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In
case of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic
that the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.
2K(s) + 2H O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H (g) + heat energy
2 2
2Na(s) + 2H O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H (g) + heat energy
2 2
The reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is
not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.
Ca(s) + 2H O(l) → Ca(OH) (aq) + H (g)
2 2 2
Calcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed
stick to the surface of the metal.
Magnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water
to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due
to the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.
Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or
hot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.
2Al(s) + 3H O(g) → Al O (s) + 3H (g)
2 2 3 2
3Fe(s) + 4H O(g) → Fe O (s) + 4H (g)

Metals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.

You have already learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and
hydrogen gas.

n Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again.
If the samples are tarnished, rub them clean with sand paper.
CAUTION: Do not take sodium and potassium as they react
vigorously even with cold water.
n Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute
hydrochloric acid.
n Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are
dipped in the acid.
n Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.
n Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?
n With which metal did you record the highest temperature?
n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute

Write equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc
and iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.
Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is
because HNO is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H produced to
3 2
water and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N O, NO,
2
NO ). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute
2
HNO to evolve H gas.

You must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation
of bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was
also the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the
order Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and
the temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does
not react with dilute HCl.

Reactive metals can displace less
reactive metals from their compounds in
solution or molten form.
We have seen in the previous sections
that all metals are not equally reactive. We
checked the reactivity of various metals
with oxygen, water and acids. But all
metals do not react with these reagents.
So we were not able to put all the metal
samples we had collected in decreasing
order of their reactivity. Displacement
reactions studied in Chapter 1 give better
evidence about the reactivity of metals. It
is simple and easy if metal A displaces

In the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of
reagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we
learnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We
learnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show
little chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements
as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.
Let us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and
some metals and non-metals.
We can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its
outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell
now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus
of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has
become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation
Na+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell

and it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine
were to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.
After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,
because its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L

You may have observed the following general properties for ionic
compounds—
(i) Physical nature: Ionic compounds are solids and are somewhat
hard because of the strong force of attraction between the positive
and negative ions. These compounds are generally brittle and
break into pieces when pressure is applied.
(ii) Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting
and boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable
amount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic
attraction.
(iii) Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in
water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.
(iv) Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through
a solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution
of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the
opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the
solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct
electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible
due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct
electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state
since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely
charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move
freely and conduct electricity.

The earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains
some soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.
The elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,
are known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high
percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted
from it. These minerals are called ores.
3.4.1 Extraction of Metals
You have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this
knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its
ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some
are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of
the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free

Al crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that
the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very

3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores
Ores mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts
of impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must
be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes
50 Science

## Page 15

used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences
between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.
Different separation techniques are accordingly employed.
3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series
Metals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these
metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar
(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted
into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury
on further heating.

3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series
The metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,
copper, are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides
or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as
compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,
the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal
oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly
in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The
carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited
air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that
takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown
as follows –
Roasting
2ZnS(s) + 3O
(g)Heat→2ZnO(s)
+ 2SO (g)
2 2
Calcination
ZnCO
(s)Heat→ZnO(s)
+ CO (g)
3 2
The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by
using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc
oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.
ZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)
You are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction
explained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds
is also a reduction process.
Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,
sometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive
metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing

agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their
compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with
aluminium powder, the following reaction takes place –
3MnO (s) + 4Al(s) → 3Mn(l) + 2Al O (s) + Heat
2 2 3
Can you identify the substances that are getting oxidised
and reduced?
These displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The
amount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced
in the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe O )
2 3
with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked
machine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.

joining railway tracks
be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,
carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,
aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals
have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained
by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium
are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals
are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,
chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The
reactions are –
At cathode Na + + e – → Na
At anode 2Cl– → Cl + 2e–
2
Similarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of
aluminium oxide.
3.4.6 Refining of Metals
The metals produced by various reduction processes
described above are not very pure. They contain
impurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.
The most widely used method for refining impure metals
is electrolytic refining.

3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion
The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,
galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.
Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting
by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is
protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you
reason this out?
Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.
We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is
the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is
because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is
mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard
and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get
stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed
with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties
of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.
The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a
homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-
metal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,
dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled
to room temperature.
Pure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making
jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,
22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is
alloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.
If one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an
amalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is
less than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and
zinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are
not good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making
electrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low
melting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.
The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy
The iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more
than 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India. They had
developed a process which prevented iron from rusting. For
its quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists
from all parts of the world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and
weighs 6 tonnes (6000 kg).
