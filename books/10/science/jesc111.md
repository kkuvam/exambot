CHAPTER
Electricity
Electricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable
and convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,
hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does
it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate
the current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt
to answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of
electric current and its applications.

We are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing
water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge
flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we
say that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we
know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide
flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We
have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What
does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and
the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an
electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the
torch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.
How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by
the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In
other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using
metallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons
were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first
observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive
charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the
direction of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the
direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the
flow of electrons, which are negative charges.

The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to
the charge contained in nearly 6 × 1018 electrons. (We know that an
electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 × 10–19 C.) The electric
current is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the
French scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836). One ampere is
constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,
1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere
(1 mA = 10–3 A) or in microampere (1 µA = 10–6 A).
An instrument called ammeter measures electric
current in a circuit. It is always connected in series
in a circuit through which the current is to be
measured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic
diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a
cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.
Note that the electric current flows in the circuit
from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative
terminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.

What makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of
flow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as
water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube
is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a
pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of
the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic
wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only
if there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –
along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a
battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within
a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,
even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a
conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in
motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to
maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its
chemical energy stored in it.
We define the electric potential difference between two points in an
electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit
charge from one point to the other –
Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)
V = W/Q (11.2)
The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after
Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the
potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor
when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one
point to the other.
1 joule
Therefore, 1 volt =
1 coulomb
(11.3)
1 V = 1 J C–1
The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called
the voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the
points between which the potential difference is to be measured.
Example 11.2
How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points
having a potential difference 12 V?
Solution
The amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential
difference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in
moving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is

In this Activity, you will find that approximately the
same value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I
graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of
the graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant
ratio.
In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm
(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current
I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference
across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the
ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly
proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its
temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In
other words –
FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111111111.....33333
V ∝ I (11.4)
V–I graph for a nichrome wire. A
straight line plot shows that as the or V/I = constant
current through a wire increases, the = R
potential difference across the wire or V = IR (11.5)
increases linearly – this is Ohm’s law.
In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire
at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the
property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. Its SI
unit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω. According to Ohm’s law,
R = V/I (11.6)
If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V
and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor
1 volt
is 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm =
1 ampere
Also from Eq. (11.5) we get
I = V/R (11.7)
It is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is
inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the
current gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase
or decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to
regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable
resistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to
change the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical
resistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.

n Complete the circuit by connecting the nichrome wire in the gap XY. Plug the key. Note
down the ammeter reading. Take out the key from the plug. [Note: Always take out the key
from the plug after measuring the current through the circuit.]
n Replace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through
it by measuring the reading of the ammeter.
n Now repeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY.
n Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY?
What do the above observations indicate?
n You may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the
ammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations.
In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different
components. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path
for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know
that motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric
current. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a
conductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among
which they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is
retarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low
resistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable
resistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a
higher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers
even higher resistance.

n Now, plug the key. Note the current in the ammeter.
n Replace the nichrome wire by another nichrome wire of same thickness but twice the
length, that is 2l [marked (2) in the Fig. 11.5].
n Note the ammeter reading.
n Now replace the wire by a thicker nichrome wire, of the same length l [marked (3)]. A
thicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the
circuit.
n Instead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the
circuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the
first nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.
n Notice the difference in the current in all cases.
n Does the current depend on the length of the conductor?
n Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?
It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when
the length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when
a thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the
circuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different
material of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.
On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the
resistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of
cross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements
have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly
proportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to the area of
cross-section (A). That is,
R ∝ l (11.8)
and R ∝ 1/A (11.9)
Combining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get

where ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical

have very low resistivity in the range of 10–8 Ω m to 10–6 Ω m. They are
good conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have
resistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance and
resistivity of a material vary with temperature.
Table 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher
than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily
at high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in
electrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used
almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and
aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.

diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the

of the wire.
Solution
We are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Ω, the diameter
d = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10-4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m.
Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is
ρ = (RA/l) = (Rπd2/4l)
Substitution of values in this gives
ρ = 1.84 × 10–6 Ω m
The resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 × 10–6 Ω m. From
Table 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese.

have noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its
resistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical
gadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore
intend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.

n Join three resistors of different values in series. Connect them
with a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6.
You may use the resistors of values like 1 Ω, 2 Ω, 3 Ω etc., and a

n Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading.
n Change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the
resistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.
n Do you find any change in the value of current through the
ammeter?
You will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is the
same, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in
a series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of
the circuit or the same current through each resistor.

that is, R″ = 10 Ω.
Thus, the total resistance, R = R′ + R″ = 18 Ω.
To calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get

connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they An electric circuit showing
need currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example the combination of series

11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one
component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.
If you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on
marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending
lot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has
to be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel
circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total
resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is
helpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and
requires different current to operate properly.

We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The
chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between
its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current
through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We
have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source
has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of
the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into
useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the
source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of
gadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric
fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other
hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of
resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets
dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating
effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric
heater, electric iron etc.
Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let
the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during
which a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q
through a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply
energy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the
source is
Q
P=V =VI (11.19)
t
Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t,
that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This
energy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady
current I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is
H = VIt (11.20)

Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get
H = I2 Rt (11.21)
This is known as Joule’s law of heating. The
law implies that heat produced in a resistor is
(i) directly proportional to the square of current
for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to
resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly
proportional to the time for which the current flows
through the resistor. In practical situations, when
an electric appliance is connected to a known

An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is
at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.
The voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each
case?
Solution
From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is
P = V I
Thus the current I = P/V
(a) When heating is at the maximum rate,
I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.
(b) When heating is at the minimum rate,
I = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.
Example 11.11
100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω resistance. Find the
potential difference across the resistor.
Solution
H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?
From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as
I = √(H/Rt)
= √[100 J/(4 Ω × 1 s)]
= 5 A
Thus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (11.5)] is
V = IR
= 5 A × 4 Ω
= 20 V.

11.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of
Electric Current
The generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of
electric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful
electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating
can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.
However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.
The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle
and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s
heating.
The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric
bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is
possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such
high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as
tungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The
filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using
insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically
inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of
the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part
of it is in the form of light radiated.
Another common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in
electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow
of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with
the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of
appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead
etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,
the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and
breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of
porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic
purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron
which consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current
of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A
fuse must be used.

You have studied in your earlier Class that the rate of doing work is
power. This is also the rate of consumption of energy.
Equation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated
or consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.
The power P is given by
P = VI
Or P = I2R = V2/R (11.22)
The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by
a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference
of 1 V. Thus,
1 W = 1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23)
The unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a
much larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical
energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,
therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when
1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy
is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.
1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second
= 3.6 × 106 watt second
= 3.6 × 106 joule (J)

Solution
