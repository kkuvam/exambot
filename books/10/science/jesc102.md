CHAPTER
Acids, Bases
and Salts
You have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter
tastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them.
If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after
overeating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon
juice, vinegar or baking soda solution?
n Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy?
Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of
acids and bases to nullify each other’s effect.
n Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting
them.
You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour
of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of
the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another
such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth
becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed
on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of
water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and
phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.
In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how
acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting
things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.

Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to
the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus
solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural
materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as
Hydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a
solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.

change in colour. There are some substances whose odour changes in
acidic or basic media. These are called olfactory indicators. Let us try

Note that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen atoms
from the acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound called a salt.
Thus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –
Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas
Can you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 22222.....44444
n Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube.
n Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents
of the test tube.
n Repeat the rest of the steps as in Activity 2.3 and record your
observations.
The reaction that takes place can be written as follows.
2NaOH(aq) + Zn(s) → Na ZnO (s) + H (g)

You find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However,
such reactions are not possible with all metals.

Limestone, chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate.
All metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with acids to give a

n Take about 2 mL of dilute NaOH solution in a test tube and add
two drops of phenolphthalein solution.
n What is the colour of the solution?
n Add dilute HCl solution to the above solution drop by drop.
n Is there any colour change for the reaction mixture?
n Why did the colour of phenolphthalein change after the addition
of an acid?
n Now add a few drops of NaOH to the above mixture.
n Does the pink colour of phenolphthalein reappear?
n Why do you think this has happened?
In the above Activity, we have observed that the effect of a base is
nullified by an acid and vice-versa. The reaction taking place is written as –
NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H O(l)

The reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is
known as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction
can be written as –
Base + Acid → Salt + Water
2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids
AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 22222.....77777
n Take a small amount of copper oxide in a beaker and add dilute
hydrochloric acid slowly while stirring.
n Note the colour of the solution. What has happened to the copper
oxide?
You will notice that the colour of the solution becomes blue-green
and the copper oxide dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution is
due to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general
reaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as –
Metal oxide + Acid → Salt + Water

Now write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since
metallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the
reaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.
2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base
You saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide
(lime water) in Activity 2.5. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts
with carbon dioxide to produce a salt and water. Since this is similar to
the reaction between a base and an acid, we can conclude that non-
metallic oxides are acidic in nature.

In Section 2.1 we have seen that all acids have similar chemical
properties. What leads to this similarity in properties? We saw in Activity
2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so
hydrogen seems to be common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity to
investigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.

The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct
electricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric
current through the solution. The electric current is carried through the
acidic solution by ions.
Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO– in
3
HNO , SO2 –in H SO , CH COO– in CH COOH. Since the cation present in
3 4 2 4 3 3
acids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in
solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.
Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium
hydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?
2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?
Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.

Note to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced
through a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.
This experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced
in the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules
cannot occur in the absence of water.
HCl + H O → H O+ + Cl–

Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining
with water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as

All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They
are soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may
cause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?
Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all
bases generate OH–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as
follows –
Acid + Base → Salt + Water
H X + M OH → MX + HOH

The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly

exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric
acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly
to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,
the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.
The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look
out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated
sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.
Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the
concentration of ions (H O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is

called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between
an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about
dilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.
Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?
Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?
We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a
mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different
colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.
A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called
pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,
meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from
0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a
number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher
the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.
The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale
represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it
represents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,
increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated
with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.

The strength of acids and bases depends on the number of H+ ions
and OH– ions produced, respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and
acetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar, then these produce
different amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H+ ions
are said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H+ ions are said to be
weak acids. Can you now say what weak and strong bases are?

Are plants and animals pH sensitive?
Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can
survive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is
less than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it
lowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers
becomes difficult.

What is the pH of the soil in your backyard?
Plants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth. To find out
the pH required for the healthy growth of a plant, you can collect the soil
from various places and check the pH in the manner described below in
Activity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the

pH in our digestive system
It is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric
acid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.
During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes
pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called
antacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the
beginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.
Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for
this purpose.
pH change as the cause of tooth decay
Tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth
enamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium
phosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in
water, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria
present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food
particles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent
this is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are
generally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and
prevent tooth decay.
Self defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare
Have you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid
which causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda
on the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject
methanoic acid causing burning pain.

Nature provides neutralisation options
Nettle is a herbaceous plant which grows in the wild. Its leaves have stinging hair,
which cause painful stings when touched accidentally. This is due to the methanoic
acid secreted by them. A traditional remedy is rubbing the
area with the leaf of the dock plant, which often grows beside
the nettle in the wild. Can you guess the nature of the dock
plant? So next time you know what to look out for if you
accidentally touch a nettle plant while trekking. Are you aware
of any other effective traditional remedies for such stings?

hand, salts of a strong acid and weak base
are acidic with pH value less than 7 and those
of a strong base and weak acid are basic in

2.4.3 Chemicals from Common Salt
By now you have learnt that the salt formed
by the combination of hydrochloric acid and
sodium hydroxide solution is called sodium
chloride. This is the salt that you use in food.
You must have observed in the above Activity
that it is a neutral salt.
Seawater contains many salts dissolved
in it. Sodium chloride is separated from these
salts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in
several parts of the world. These large crystals
are often brown due to impurities. This is
called rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed
when seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt
is mined like coal.
You must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did
you know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our
struggle for freedom?

Common salt — A raw material for chemicals
The common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various
materials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing
soda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance
is used for making all these different substances.
Sodium hydroxide
When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium
chloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The
process is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–
chlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.
2NaCl(aq) + 2H O(l) fi 2NaOH(aq) + Cl (g) + H (g)
2 2 2
Chlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.
Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three
products produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the
different uses of these products.
Figure 2.8 Important products from the chlor-alkali process
Bleaching powder
You have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the
electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used
for the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced
by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH) ]. Bleaching powder
2
is represented as Ca(ClO) , though the actual composition is quite
2
complex.

Bleaching powder is used –
(i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching
wood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes
in laundry;
(ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and
(iii) to make drinking water free from germs.
Baking soda
The baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy
pakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical
name of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO ). It is
3
produced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.
NaCl + H O + CO + NH → NH Cl + NaHCO
2 2 3 4 3
(Ammonium (Sodium
chloride) hydrogencarbonate)
Did you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?
Can you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild
non-corrosive basic salt. The following reaction takes place when it is
heated during cooking –
2NaHCO
Heat→Na
CO +H O+CO
3 2 3 2 2
(Sodium (Sodium
hydrogencarbonate) carbonate)
Sodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.
Uses of Baking soda
(i) For making baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda
(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as
tartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,
the following reaction takes place –
NaHCO + H+ → CO + H O + Sodium salt of acid
3 2 2
(From any acid)
Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or
cake to rise making them soft and spongy.
(ii) Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.
Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and
provides relief.
(iii) It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.
Washing soda
Another chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is
Na CO .10H O (washing soda). You have seen above that sodium
2 3 2
carbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of
sodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.
Na CO +10H O→Na CO .10H O

What does 10H O signify? Does it make Na CO wet? We will address
2 2 3
this question in the next section.
Sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate are useful
chemicals for many industrial processes as well.
Uses of washing soda
(i) Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and
paper industries.
(ii) It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.
(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic
purposes.
(iv) It is used for removing permanent hardness of water.
2.4.4 Are the Crystals of Salts really Dry?

n Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate
in a dry boiling tube.
n What is the colour of the copper
sulphate after heating?
n Do you notice water droplets in the
boiling tube? Where have these come
from?
n Add 2-3 drops of water on the sample
of copper sulphate obtained after
heating.
n What do you observe? Is the blue
colour of copper sulphate restored?
FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 22222.....99999 Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of
Removing water crystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the
of crystallisation
salt turns white.
If you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue
colour of the crystals reappears.
Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present
in one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one
formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper
sulphate is Cu SO . 5H O. Now you would be able to answer the question
4 2
whether the molecule of Na CO .10H O is wet.
2 3 2
One other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.
It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical
formula CaSO .2H O. Let us look into the use of this salt.

water. Plaster of Paris is used for making toys, materials for decoration
and for making surfaces smooth. Try to find out why is calcium sulphate
