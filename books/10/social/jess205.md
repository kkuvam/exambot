Consumers International
In 1985 United Nations adopted
the UN Guidelines for Consumer
Protection. This was a tool for
nations to adopt measures to
protect consumers and for
consumer advocacy groups to
press their governments to do
so. At the international level, this
has become the foundation for
consumer movement. Today,
Consumers International has
become an umbrella body to
over 200 member organisations
from over 100 countries.
Because of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in
bringing pressure on business firms as well as government
to correct business conduct which may be unfair and against
the interests of consumers at large. A major step taken in
1986 by the Indian government was the enactment of the
Consumer Protection Act 1986, popularly known as COPRA.
You will learn more about COPRA later.

The enactment of COPRA has led
to the setting up of separate
Departments of Consumer Affairs in

You might also be seeing such
advertisements on television channels.
IIIIISSSSSIIIII aaaaannnnnddddd AAAAAgggggmmmmmaaaaarrrrrkkkkk
While buying many commodities, on the
cover, you might have seen a logo with the
letters ISI, Agmark, Hallmark or +F. These
logos and certification help consumers get
assured of quality while purchasing the
goods and services. The organisations that
monitor and issue these certificates allow
producers to use their logos provided they
follow certain quality standards.
Though these organisations develop quality
standards for many products, it is not
compulsory for all the producers to follow
standards. However, for some products that
affect the health and safety of consumers or
of products of mass consumption like LPG
cylinders, food colours and additives,
cement, packaged drinking water, it is
mandatory on the part of the producers to
get certified by these organisations.
