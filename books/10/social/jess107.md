and maintained. The growing importance of
road transport vis-à-vis rail transport is
rooted in the following reasons; (a)
construction cost of roads is much lower
than that of railway lines, (b) roads can
traverse comparatively more dissected and
undulating topography, (c) roads can
negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as
such can traverse mountains such as the
Himalayas, (d) road transport is economical
in transportation of few persons and
relatively smaller amount of goods over
short distances, (e) it also provides door-
to-door service, thus the cost of loading
and unloading is much lower, (f) road
transport is also used as a feeder to other
