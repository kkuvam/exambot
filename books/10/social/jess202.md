SECTORS
OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY
SECTORS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
Let us look at these pictures. You will find that people are
engaged in various economic activities. Some of these are
activities producing goods. Some others are producing
services. These activities are happening around us every
minute even as we speak. How do we understand these
activities? One way of doing this is to group them (classify
them) using some important criterion. These groups are also
called sectors.

## Page 5

COMPARING THE THREE SECTORS
The various production activities in the primary, secondary and
tertiary sectors produce a very large number of goods and
services. Also, the three sectors have a large number of people
working in them to produce these goods and services. The next
step, therefore, is to see how much goods and services are
produced and how many people work in each sector. In an
economy there could be one or more sectors which are dominant
in terms of total production and employment, while other sectors
are relatively small in size.
How do we count the various goods and services
and know the total production in each sector?
With so many thousands of goods and services produced, you
might think this is an impossible task! Not only would the task
be enormous, you might also wonder how we can add up cars
and computers and nails and furniture. It won’t make sense!!!
You are right in thinking so. To get around this problem,
economists suggest that the values of goods and services should
be used rather than adding up the actual numbers. For example,
if 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg, the value of
wheat will be Rs 2,00,000. The value of 5000 coconuts at Rs
15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000. Similarly, the value of goods
and services in the three sectors are calculated, and then added
up.
Remember, there is one precaution one has to take. Not every
good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be counted. It
makes sense only to include the final goods and services. Take,
for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a flour mill for Rs 20 per
kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells the flour to a biscuit
company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour
and things such as sugar and oil to make four packets of biscuits.
It sells biscuits in the market to the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20
per packet). Biscuits are the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the
consumers.
Why are only ‘final goods and services’ counted? In contrast
to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat flour in this
example are intermediate goods. Intermediate goods are used
up in producing final goods and services. The value of final
goods already includes the value of all the intermediate goods
that are used in making the final good. Hence, the value of Rs
80 for the biscuits (final good) already includes the value of
flour (Rs 25). Similarly, the value of all other intermediate goods
...BUT I SHOULD BE PAID THE would have been included. To count the value of the flour and

wheat separately is therefore not correct because then we would

be counting the value of the same things a number of times.
First as wheat, then as flour and finally as biscuits.

9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. She gets her salary regularly
at the end of every month. In addition to the salary,
she also gets provident fund as per the rules laid
down by the government. She also gets medical and
other allowances. Kanta does not go to office on
Sundays. This is a paid holiday. When she joined
work, she was given an appointment letter stating

LET’S RECALL
With so many activities taking place around us, one needs to use the
process of classification to think in a useful manner. The criterion for
classification could be many depending on what we desire to find out.
The process of classification helps to analyse a situation.
In dividing the economic activities into three sectors — primary,
secondary, tertiary — the criterion used was the ‘nature of activity’. On
the basis of this classification, we were able to analyse the pattern of total
production and employment in India. Similarly, we divided the economic
activities into organised and unorganised and used the classification to
look at employment in the two sectors.
What was the most important conclusion that was derived from the
classification exercises? What were the problems and solutions that were
indicated? Can you summarise the information in the following table?
