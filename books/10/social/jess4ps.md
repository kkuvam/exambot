Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This
principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and
community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify
an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage
rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in
the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and
to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given
space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging
with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed
textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other
resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative
is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily timetable is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
days is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular
burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority
and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in
small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory
group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan. We also wish to thank
the Chief Advisors for this book, Professors Yogendra Yadav and Suhas
Palshikar along with Advisor for this book, Professor K. C. Suri for guiding
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development
of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible.
We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously

permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially
grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource
Development under the Chairmanship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed
to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products,
NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake
further revision and refinement.

Rationalisation of Content
in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises
upon reducing the content load and providing opportunities for
experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the
NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across
all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT
across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the
following
• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas
in the same class
• Similar content included in the lower or higher class
in the same subject
• High difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children
through self-learning or peer-learning.
• Content, which is not relevant in the present context or outdated.
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

A Letter for You
Dear students, teachers and parents,
Political Science textbooks for Class IX and Class X together form an
integrated whole. That is why we called them Democratic Politics-I and
Democratic Politics-II. This book begins where the Political Science textbook
stopped last year in Class IX. Last year, the tour of democracy introduced you
mainly to some basic ideas, institutions and rules of democracy. This year, the
focus shifts from the institutions to the process. The book introduces you to
how democracy works in practice and what can be expected of it.
As a result of this shift, you would read much more directly about politics in
this book. Politics is about how thinking human beings determine and change the
way they live together. This involves ideas and ideals, cooperation and coordination.
This also involves conflict and competition, self and collective interest. Therefore
much of democratic politics is about power sharing.
This forms the subject matter of the first four chapters in this book. In these
chapters, we explore various forms of sharing and shaping of power in a democracy.
Chapters One and Two constitute the first unit that presents the idea of power
sharing and elaborates it in the context of power sharing between different levels of
government. The second unit is about power sharing and accommodation among
different social groups. The next chapter tells us how different political organisations
and movements are important in democratic politics. The fifth chapter takes up the
larger questions with which we began our tour last year. Thus, what democracies
have achieved and what is yet to be achieved is discussed in the fifth chapter on
outcomes. Thus ends the tour of democracy we began last year. As we travel through
the different chapters, the meaning of democracy expands.
This book is a continuation of the Class IX textbook in another sense as well.
Last year, the textbook had introduced a different style and form. Since we have had
a very positive feedback from many of you regarding these features, we continue
the experiment this year as well. This book also interacts with the students with the
help of stories, illustrations, puzzles and cartoons. This time we have increased the
visual elements and introduced a new feature called ‘Plus Box’. Do read about all the
old and new features in the ‘How to Use this Book’. Above all, this book does not
seek to teach and preach about democracy. It seeks to engage in a conversation with
you. You would agree that this is a democratic way of thinking about democracy.
We were fortunate this year as well that some of the leading political scientists
of the country agreed to join the Textbook Development Committee. We would
like to express our deep appreciation of the support we received in preparing this
textbook from Professor Krishna Kumar and Professor Hari Vasudevan and the
advice received from the National Monitoring Committee. We would like to thank
Professor Satish Deshpande for reading specific chapters and giving comments. A
group of teachers and educationists comprising Anuradha Sen, Suman Lata, Manish

Jain, Radhika Menon, Malini Ghose, Alex M. George and Pankaj Pushkar read the
drafts and made valuable suggestions. We would like to make a special mention of the
untiring efforts of Alex and Pankaj, the two ‘super advisors’ of this book, to ensure
that what is presented in the book was accurate, interesting and communicative.
Parthiv Shah and Shroboni gave the book its attractive look. Irfan Khan once again
created new-look Unni and Munni for you. Ahmed Raza of ARK Grafix provided
with informative and appealing graphics and maps. We are highly thankful to the
Lokniti and Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) for providing a
congenial home for the textbook development committee, for sparing space and
resources for this enterprise during the last two years.
At the end of this academic year, you will be taking the Board examinations.
We wish you all the best in your examinations. We wish and hope that the tour
of democracy undertaken in these two books will help you overcome two most
common reactions: that Political Science is boring and that politics is disgusting.
We hope you will continue to take interest in a critical and balanced understanding
of democratic politics either by opting for Political Science as a subject or by acting
as a responsible citizen in future.

How to Use this Book
This book retains several features with which you are familiar. These were
introduced in your Political Science textbook for Class IX. This book also
has some new features that you might wish to know about.
Overview
comes at the beginning of every chapter. It tells you about the
purpose of the chapter and what is covered in it. Please read the overview
before and after reading the chapter.
Section and sub-section headings:
Each chapter is divided into
sections and sub-sections. A section heading spreads over both columns on
the page. This indicates the beginning a major part of the chapter and often
covers a topic specified in the syllabus. The sub-section heading in a column
indicates one point under the section concerned.
Graphics, Collages, Photographs and Posters occupy more space in this
textbook than they did in your textbook for Class IX. You would continue
to find a wide range of political Cartoons. These images provide visual relief
and some fun. But you should not merely ‘see’ these images and turn the page.
You are expected to ‘read’ the meaning of these images. Very often politics
is carried out not through words but through images. The captions and
questions that often accompany these images help you to read these images.
Munni and Unni are back with you. Like you, they have also grown up
a little since you met them in Class IX. They keep popping up and asking
questions that you may have wished to ask. Do stop to engage with their
questions. And don’t hesitate to ask similar questions to your teachers and
parents.
+
Plus boxes contain supplementary information related to the theme of the
chapter. Sometimes the plus box has a story that invites you to reflect on
the dilemmas concerning our social and political life. You are supposed to
read and discuss these. But you need not memorise the information and
contents of the plus box. Nor is there a ‘correct’ answer to some of the moral
questions posed there. These are just meant to help you think hard. Each
plus box carries a special + sign.

Let us watch television, Let us listen to radio, Let us read newspaper, Let us
debate, Let’s find out or Let’s do it give students some activity in or outside
the classroom. These activities become more meaningful when the students
present their findings to the entire class and have the space for discussion. Where
necessary, please feel free to substitute one type of media with another.
Glossary appears at the margin of the page in which an unfamiliar word or
expression comes in the text. Such a word is highlighted in the text. Remember,
you don’t need to learn the definition by heart. You just need to understand the
word.
Let us revise usually comes at the end of every section. The questions invite you
to apply the points learnt in that section to a specific situation. Teachers can
come up with more such in-text exercises and use these to check the progress
that everyone has made.
Exercises come at the end of every chapter. You would notice that we have
introduced some new kinds of exercises, particularly in multiple choice format,
which require reasoning and application of mind. Once you become familiar
with the format, you would enjoy the challenge.
Maps are essential not just for understanding geography but also for history and
politics. That is why some of the information is presented by way of maps in
this book. You are not expected to draw the maps, but understand the patterns
depicted here.
