As consumers in today’s world, some
of us have a wide choice of goods and
services before us. The latest models
of digital cameras, mobile phones and
televisions made by the leading
manufacturers of the world are within
our reach. Every season, new models
of automobiles can be seen on Indian
roads. Gone are the days when
Ambassador and Fiat were the only
cars on Indian roads. Today, Indians
are buying cars produced by nearly
all the top companies in the world. A
similar explosion of brands can be
seen for many other goods: from shirts
to televisions to processed fruit juices.
Such wide-ranging choice of goods
in our markets is a relatively recent
phenomenon. You wouldn’t have
found such a wide variety of goods in
Indian markets even two decades
back. In a matter of years, our
markets have been transformed!
How do we understand these
rapid transformations? What are the
factors that are bringing about these
changes? And, how are these changes
affecting the lives of the people?
We shall dwell on these questions in
this chapter.

A large MNC, producing industrial equipment, designs its
products in research centres in the United States, and then
has the components manufactured in China. These are then
shipped to Mexico and Eastern Europe where the products
are assembled and the finished products are sold all over the
world. Meanwhile, the company’s customer care is carried out
through call centres located in India.
This is a call centre in Bengaluru, equipped with telecom facilities and access to

But the most common route for
MNC investments is to buy up local
companies and then to expand
production. MNCs with huge wealth
can quite easily do so. To take an
example, Cargill Foods, a very large
American MNC, has bought over
smaller Indian companies such as
Parakh Foods. Parakh Foods had
built a large marketing network in
various parts of India, where its brand
was well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods
had four oil refineries, whose control
has now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is
now the largest producer of edible oil
in India, with a capacity to make 5
million pouches daily!
In fact, many of the top MNCs
have wealth exceeding the entire
budgets of the developing country Jeans produced in developing countries being

governments. With such enormous
wealth, imagine the power and
influence of these MNCs!
There’s another way in which The products are supplied to the

Thus, we see that there are a

setting up partnerships with local

or buying them up, MNCs are exerting
a strong influence on production

result, production in these widely

Competition and Uncertain Employment
Globalisation and the pressure of competition have substantially changed the lives
of workers. Faced with growing competition, most employers these days prefer to
employ workers ‘flexibly’. This means that workers’ jobs are no longer secure.
Let us see how the workers in the garment export industry
in India are having to bear this pressure of competition.
Factory workers folding garments for export. Though globalisation has created opportunities for paid work for
women, the condition of employment shows that women are denied their fair share of benefits.

The conditions of work and the hardships of the workers described above
have become common to many industrial units and services in India. Most
workers, today, are employed in the unorganised sector. Moreover, increasingly
conditions of work in the organised sector have come to resemble the
unorganised sector. Workers in the organised sector such as Sushila no longer
