Outcomes of
Democracy
Overview
As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to move
beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of
questions: What does democracy do? Or, what outcomes can we
reasonably expect of democracy? Also, does democracy fulfil these
expectations in real life? We begin by thinking about how to assess
the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think on
this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes
of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic
well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally
freedom and dignity.

thinking carefully about the outcomes
of democracy is to recognise
that democracy is just a form
of government. It can only create
conditions for achieving something.
The citizens have to take advantage
of those conditions and achieve
those goals. Let us examine some of
the things we can reasonably expect
from democracy and examine the
record of democracy.

citizens should be able to participate

outcome of democracy should
be that it produces a government

Economic outcomes
of
democracy
Arguments about democracy tend to be
Poor Kids
very passionate. This is how it should
be, for democracy appeals to some of
our deep values. These debates cannot
be resolved in a simple manner. But
some debates about democracy can and
should be resolved by referring to some
facts and figures. The debate about the
economic outcomes of democracy is
one such debate. Over the years, many
students of democracy have gathered
careful evidence to see what the
relationship of democracy with economic
growth and economic inequalities is.
The tables and the cartoon here present
some of the evidences:
 Table 1 shows that on an average dictatorial regimes have had a slightly better record
of economic growth. But when we compare their record only in poor countries, there is
virtually no difference.
 Table 2 shows that within democracies there can be very high degree of inequalities.
In democratic countries like South Africa and Brazil, the top 20 per cent people take away
more than 60 per cent of the national income, leaving less than 3 per cent for the bottom
20 per cent population. Countries like Denmark and Hungary are much better in this
respect.
 You can see in the cartoon, there is often inequality of opportunities available to the
poorer sections.
What would be your verdict on democracy if you had to base it purely on economic
performance of democratic regimes in terms of growth and equal distribution?

Reduction of inequality and poverty
Perhaps more than development, it
is reasonable to expect democracies
to reduce economic disparities. Even
when a country achieves economic
growth, will wealth be distributed
in such a way that all citizens of the
country will have a share and lead
a better life? Is economic growth
in democracies accompanied by
increased inequalities among the
people? Or do democracies lead
to a just distribution of goods and
opportunities?

8. Read the passage below:
Nannu is a daily wage earner. He lives in Welcome Mazdoor
Colony, a slum habitation in East Delhi. He lost his ration card
and applied for a duplicate one in January 2004. He made
several rounds to the local Food and Civil Supplies office for
the next three months. But the clerks and officials would
not even look at him, leave alone do his job or bother to
tell him the status of his application. Ultimately, he filed an
application under the Right to Information Act asking for the
daily progress made on his application, names of the officials,
who were supposed to act on his application and what action
would be taken against these officials for their inaction. Within
a week of filing application under the Right to Information Act,
he was visited by an inspector from the Food Department,
who informed him that the card had been made and he could
collect it from the office. When Nannu went to collect his card
next day, he was given a very warm treatment by the Food
and Supply Officer (FSO), who is the head of a Circle. The FSO
offered him tea and requested him to withdraw his application
under the Right to Information, since his work had already
been done.
What does Nannu’s example show? What impact did Nannu’s
action have on officials? Ask your parents their experiences
when they approach government officials to attend to their
problems.
