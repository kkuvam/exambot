FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning,
which continues to shape our system, and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of
sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-
centered system of education outlined in the National Policy on
Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by
adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites
of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson
of the advisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the
secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for
this book, Professor Tapas Majumdar for guiding the work of this
committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this

textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible.
We are indebted to the institutions and organisations, which have
generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National
Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary
and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an
organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous
improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments
and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision
and refinement.

A FEW INTRODUCTORY WORDS FOR TEACHERS
This book introduces you to a simplified view of the process of development in
the Indian economy. In Economics, we usually try to look at development as a
process of change in the economic life of the people, as producers or consumers
of goods and services. Sometimes, development is studied mainly as a
phenomenon that acquired significance only with the growth of the modern
industrial civilisation. This is because the state of development (or
underdevelopment) of a country has often depended on outcomes of wars and
conquests and on colonial exploitation of one country by another. However, in
this book, we have not emphasised on the external factors. We have taken a
long view of the process of development: a process that could have started
before any external factors intervened or interrupted it. The process of
development may also restart after such interruptions, and continue on
independent lines after the period of subjugation ends. This has happened in
the case of our own country, India.
In this book the first beginnings of development are seen in terms of the
emergence of agriculture, manufacturing and services as three distinct sectors
of the economy. We have also tried to look at economic development not in
isolation but as part of a more general concept of human development that
includes the development of health and education and other indicators that,
along with income, broadly define the quality of life of a people.
In the first chapter, we will study how people actually perceive development
and how it can be measured. There are various measures available for this
purpose. We will look at the extent to which some of the important developmental
indicators help in understanding development and how the process may affect
different people differently.
Development as a process had probably started quite early in history. To
begin with, perhaps no country could be distinguished as developed in the
sense that we understand development. Perhaps the process would have started
in most human settlements when people started living in relative peace and in
more or less fixed habitations without which agriculture would not have been
possible on any significant scale. Once agriculture began and developed, the
extraction of other natural products, like mineral ores, probably was started.
This latter process of recovering stones and other minerals is called ‘quarrying’.
Humans learnt to use the non-food products like wood from trees and the
minerals obtained from quarrying as raw materials for making their tools,
weapons, utensils, fishing nets and so on. These were the first human-made
products called ‘artefacts’. Economists called the process of making the artefacts
‘manufacture’ as distinguished from ‘agriculture (including quarrying)’ that
covered the gathering, cultivating or extracting of purely natural products such
as fruit, rice or minerals.
The separation of productive activities between the two distinct sectors of
agriculture including quarrying (also called the Primary Sector) and
(v)

## Page 6

manufacture (also called the Secondary Sector) was probably the first visible
manifestation of economic development. This separation came about through
the process of “division of labour” as Adam Smith, regarded as the father of
economics had called it. The process is briefly explained below.
At first every person, or at least members of every household, presumably,
had to do everything all by themselves. Then at some point the advantage of
‘division of labour’ must have been felt. Humans found out with experience
that production became more efficient if some people concentrated on learning
how to fish, others on how to till the soil, still others on how to produce
pottery, or trap or hunt animals and birds for food and so on. This was also
‘development’ of a kind. Then there emerged specialists who were not
themselves producing any good at all: they were people specialising in
teaching others how to do these things better. There were also doctors who
healed people when they were injured or had fallen ill. Naturally division of
labour between people increased the productivity of all the people and the
economy grew.
The second chapter will look at the way economic activities in a modern
economy can be classified and understood within the framework of primary,
secondary and tertiary sectors. The discussion here is focussed on India and
the changes that have occurred in the three sectors over the past decades. Besides
this, it also provides two other ways of classifying economic activities — organised
and unorganised, and private and public sectors. The relevance of additional
ways of classification for understanding the problems and challenges of the
modern Indian economy is illustrated using real life examples and case studies.
The third chapter initiates the learners into the world of money — its role in
a modern economy, forms and its linkage with various institutions such as
banks. Then the chapter moves on to discuss the role of banks and other
institutions in providing credit to the people. Issues stressed in the discussion
on credit are (a) pervasiveness of credit in economic life across a very large
section of the population (b) the preponderance of informal credit in India and
(c) role of credit in creating either a self-sustaining virtuous cycle of productive
investment, higher income streams, higher standards of living leading to more
productive investments contributing to development, or a vicious cycle of
indebtedness, poverty and debt-trap leading to increased poverty. These ideas
are presented through case studies.
Globalisation is an important phenomenon, which has influenced
development and people around the world in various ways. The fourth chapter
focuses on a particular dimension of globalisation that is economic in nature
— the complex organisation of production. How multinational companies
facilitate globalisation through trade and investment is also explained. Some
important factors and institutions that facilitate globalisation also find place
in this chapter. In the end, the chapter appraises the impacts of globalisation
(positive and negative) on the Indian economy.
The process of development leads to not only higher levels of production in
different sectors of the economy, but has some down sides too. The examples
Labour is the and case studies in this chapter and elsewhere try to examine whether the
source of all
benefits of development are spreading to all people (producers big and small,
wealth
workers in the organised or unorganised sectors, consumers belonging to all

income groups, men and women and so on) or are being confined to only some
privileged sections.
Our final chapter presents a relevant study of how, and to what extent, we
can protect the rights of citizens as consumers. During the process of rapid
development and emergence of new brands and advertisement campaigns by
unscrupulous producers, consumers are often at the receiving end of business
malpractices. After tracing the historical root of the consumer movement and
through various real-life instances, this chapter tells of different inexpensive
consumer protection mechanisms evolved over the years. It also offers details
of how people can now assert some of their rights at very little expense at the THIS IS GOOD
DEVELOPMENT!
special consumer courts that operate outside the existing cumbersome,
expensive and time-consuming legal procedures.
Features of this Textbook
The purpose of the book is to understand the economic life around us and
also to think about what we would mean by economic development for people.
There are many examples and case studies that we have used both as an
aid for conceptual clarity and to relate these ideas to real life. These have to
be read and used, keeping this overall objective in view.
The chapters start with NNNNNooooottttteeeee fffffooooorrrrr ttttthhhhheeeee ttttteeeeeaaaaaccccchhhhheeeeerrrrr. Teachers could read this page
before they start teaching a chapter. It contains the details of (i) the broad approach
and content of the chapter; (ii) some pointers to how the chapter could be taught;
and (iii) sources for additional details relating to different topics.
There are several internal exercises in LLLLLeeeeettttt’’’’’sssss wwwwwooooorrrrrkkkkk ttttthhhhhiiiiisssss ooooouuuuuttttt, given after
each section in the chapters. This contains a few questions to review the section
and open-ended questions and activities that can be taken up within and
outside the classroom. Some of the internal exercises should be done in the
discussion mode. Students can discuss these in groups and present their
conclusions and the answers may be put up for debate with the entire class.
This will require more time but it is essential as this allows students to
explore and learn from each other. The intention is to allow for more
interaction than is usually observed but there is no fixed formula for doing
this. Each teacher would find his or her own ways and we would like to
express our faith in their abilities to do so.
Wherever possible, we have attempted to provide the latest statistics. Not all
authentic data is available for the recent years. Also, economic trends do not
change in a few years. Rather worrying about the latest data, you may bring to
the notice the central idea of what the concept and data related to it convey to
us. Questions on the data aspects may be avoided.
We have used many reference material while preparing this book. Besides
these, many news clippings, reports from government and
non-government organisations were also used. Some of them are mentioned
in the NNNNNooooottttteeeee fffffooooorrrrr ttttthhhhheeeee ttttteeeeeaaaaaccccchhhhheeeeerrrrr and some in SSSSSuuuuuggggggggggeeeeesssssttttteeeeeddddd RRRRReeeeeaaaaadddddiiiiinnnnngggggsssss given at
the end of this book.
It is important that aaaaaddddddddddiiiiitttttiiiiiooooonnnnnaaaaalllll iiiiinnnnnfffffooooorrrrrmmmmmaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn aaaaannnnnddddd rrrrreeeeeaaaaadddddiiiiinnnnngggggsssss be brought
into classroom discussion. This could be in the form of short surveys, interviews
with people around, reference books, or newspaper clippings, etc. These should
then be used for reflection and creative expression by students themselves in
the form of making charts, wallpaper displays, skits, debates, etc.

Evaluation
While addressing the need for reforms in education, the National Curriculum
Framework 2005 and the Position Paper of the National Focus Group on
Examination Reforms call for a change in the way questions are asked in
examinations. The questions asked in this book make a departure from an
evaluation pattern that encourages rote-memorisation to one that inculcates
creative thinking, imagination, reflection and hones the analytical ability of
learners. Based on the examples shown here, teachers can formulate additional
questions.
Questions that test the understanding of core concepts
(a)GDP is the total value of _________ produced during a particular year.
(i) all goods and services
(ii) all final goods and services
(iii) all intermediate goods and services
(iv) all intermediate and final goods and services
(b)Analyse the role of credit for development.
(c)In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to interlinking
of production?
(d)How would flexibility in labour laws help companies?
Questions to assess analytical abilities, interpretation and coherent
presentation
(a)The following table gives the GDP in Rupees (crores) by the three secors:
Year primary secondary tertiary
2000 12,56,000 10,12,000 18,17,000
2013 17,87,000 24,59,000 46,30,000
(i) Calculate the share of the three sectors in GDP for 2000 and 2013.
(ii) Show the data as a bar diagram similar to Graph 2 in the chapter 2.
(iii) What conclusions can we draw from the bar graph?
(b)In India, about 80 per cent of farmers are small farmers, who need credit for
cultivation.
(i) Why might banks be unwilling to lend to small farmers?
(ii) What are the other sources from which small farmers can borrow?
(iii) Explain with an example how the terms of credit can be unfavourable for
the small farmer.
(iv) Suggest some ways by which small farmers can get cheap credit.

Questions to test reflective thinking
(a)Look at the picture (high rise buildings with slums around). What should be the
developmental goals for such an area?
(b)“The Earth has enough resources to meet the needs of all but not enough to satisfy
the greed of even one person”. How is this statement relevant to the discussion of
development? Discuss.
(c)“Tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of Indian
economy”. Do you agree? Give reasons in support of your answer.
(d)People make complaints about the lack of civic amenities such as bad roads or
poor water and health facilities but no one listens. Now the RTI Act gives you the
power to question. Do you agree? Discuss.
Questions that test the ability to apply concepts and ideas to real life
problems / situations
(a)What can be some of the developmental goals for your village, town or locality?
(b)Students in a school are often classified into primary and secondary or junior and
senior. What is the criterion used here? Do you think this is useful classification?
(c)In what ways can employment be increased in urban areas?
(d)What do you understand by disguised unemployment? Explain with an example
each from the urban and rural areas.
(e)Describe some of your duties as consumers if you visit a shopping complex in
your locality.
It is also necessary to develop questions that require students to draw from
one or more areas of the syllabus for making relevant connections between
materials from different chapters. For instance, in Chapter 4 one question links
to Chapter 1— In chapter 1, we saw what may be development for one may
be destructive for others. The setting of SEZs has been opposed by some
people in India. Find out who are these people and why are they opposing it.
We hope that you along with your students would look at this textbook
itself in a critical manner and send us your critique, questions, clarification,
etc. to the following address. AND we could continue this discussion further.
