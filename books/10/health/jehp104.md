You might have participated in different games and
sports. There are two broad categories of competitions
which are played as individual games and team games.
Team games are represented by more than two players.
The example of team games are Football, Cricket, Hockey,
Basketball, Volleyball, etc. Individual games are played
with different events like, singles events, doubles or mixed
events.
There are many individual sports, for example, Badminton,
Table Tennis, Tennis, Swimming, Judo, Wrestling, etc. Track
and field is also an individual sport which we will discuss in Activity 4.1

Track and Field
Track and field events are comprised with running events
and field events. All running events are held in the track
and categorised as short distance, middle distance and
long distance running, race walk, hurdles and steeplechase
events.
Field events are categorised as, throwing and jumping
events. There are “combined events” which includes decathlon
for men and heptathlon for women. Decathlon which is
organised for men includes 10 events and Heptathlon for
women includes 7 events. The events are described below
with the help of Table 4.1.

at Greece in 1896 was marked as new era for track and
36 field events which was initiated by Pierre-de-Coubertin.
Until the early 1920s, only males were participating in the
track and field events. Introduction of five track and field events
for women in the athletics was started during 1928 Summer
Olympics. Gradually more women’s events were introduced as
time progressed. However, it was only towards the second half
of the twentieth century that the men’s and women’s track and
field events were given equal status. Furthermore, major track
and field events for disabled athletes were first introduced
at the 1960 Summer Para Olympics. From 1990’s onwards,
track and field events became increasingly more professional.

Sprints
Sprinting is the name given to short distance running in
which the runner tries to maintain maximum speed for the
whole race. These include track events covering distances
of 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters,
4×100 meters relay, 4×400 meters
relay, and hurdle races of 100 meters
for women, 110 meters for men and 400
meters for both men and women. At the
professional level, sprinters begin the
race by assuming a crouching position on
the starting blocks. Then they lean their
body forward and gradually move into an
upright position as the race progresses
and momentum is gained. Athlete remain
in the same lane on the running track
throughout the sprinting distance. The
man or woman who runs fastest and takes

The winner is often named ‘the fastest man/woman in the
competition’. Some sprint events start in lanes, to cover the

Fig. 4.4: Middle distance running
The middle distance races are of 800 meters and 1500
meters. Runners start the race from a standing start position
in the lanes along a curved starting line or in staggered lanes.
However the distance is same for each runner. After hearing
the starter’s pistol, they head forward in the designated lane
or move towards the innermost track to follow the shortest
route to the finish. Athletes rely more on speed endurance and

pacing than just pure speed. Middle-distance races require
different skills and tactics to win the sprints competition.
These races require that the athletes maintain a plateau
pace, (i.e. the maintenance of speed at which the runner
is running) that allows for a final spurt of speed, whereas
sprint races need to be run at top speed for the entire length
of the race.
Long distance
There are four common long distance running events in track and
field. These are 3000 meters, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters
and 3000 meters steeplechase. Long distance track races have
much in common with middle distance races. However, in these
races, pacing, endurance, and race tactics play an important
role in performance. In these events, runners need to balance
their energy to win the race.

Relays
Relay races are the only track events in which a team of
runners directly compete against other teams. Common relay
races are the 4×100 meter and the 4×400 meter. The exchange
of baton takes place within a specified
area of the track called baton exchange
zone. Teams may be disqualified if the
team fails to complete the baton exchange
within an area of 20 meters, the team is
considered as disqualified. A team may
also be disqualified if its runners have
deliberately created hurdle for the other
competitors. The 4×100 meter event is
run strictly within the same lane on the
track. It means that the team collectively
runs one complete circuit of the track.

• In most international competitions, the command of
the starter is “on your marks” and “set” for crouch start
and “on your mark” for standing start.
• Any sprinter with a false start is considered disqualified.
• Athletes are not permitted to run inside the inner curve of
the track. They have to run in their designated lanes only.
Running
• In all races that are run in lanes, athletes have keep
themselves their allocated lanes from start to finish.
This also applies to any portion of a race run in lanes.
• If an athlete leaves the track or steps on the line
demarking the track, this will be considered
disqualified.
• An athlete, after voluntarily leaving the track shall not
be allowed to continue in race.
• Any athlete found intentionally obstructing the path of
another runner is also disqualified from the race.
• There are races that start in lanes and then at a “break
line”, the competitors merge. Examples of this are the
800 meters and 4x400 relay race.
Finishing
• The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide.
Competitors are placed in the order in which any part
of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck,
arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of
the nearer edge of the finish line.
• The measurement of time shall be taken from the
flash or the smoke of the gun to the finishing touch,
which shall be recorded in 1/100th of a second if taken
manually. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for
high level meets.

Field evenTs
Field events constitute of events that are participated by men
and women outside the track. These include jumping events
(Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump and Pole Vault) and
throwing events (Shot Put, Discus Throw, Javelin Throw and
Hammer Throw).
Jumping events
The jumping events comprise Long Jump, Triple Jump, High
Jump and Pole Vault.
1. Long jump: The long jump is one of the oldest field
events. The take-off has to be made from a 20 cm
wide board one meter away from a pit. Athletes
sprint along a length of track to a take off board and
a sandpit. If any part of the runner’s foot goes past
the takeoff board, the jumper is considered for a foul
43
and does not receive score for that round. Distance
is measured from the end of the takeoff board to the
nearest mark made by the jumper on the pit. Best
eight competitors have a maximum of six rounds.
Professional long jumpers typically have strong
acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes
must also have a consistent stride to allow them to
take off near the board while still maintaining their
maximum speed.
Fig. 4.11: Long jump
2. Triple jump: Similar to the long jump, the triple jump
takes place on a field heading towards a sandpit.
This event is termed as the “hop-step and jump.”
The event begins like a long jump, with competitor
dashing down the runway and leaping from a takeoff
board they first hop then take a step and then jump
into the pit. The event is scored identically to the
long jump.

a height advances to the next round. They are
ranked according to the height they clear. An athlete
is allowed a maximum of three trials of each height.
Competitors are eliminated after missing (failing) three
consecutive jumps in a particular height. Athletes
have a short run up and then take off from near one
foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto
a cushioned landing area. Jumping technique has
played a significant part in the history of the event.
The modern technique of high jump as shown in the
figure is known as “Fosbury Flop”.

fiberglass or carbon fiber. The atheletes then push
themselves over the crossbar and land onto the mattress.
Fig. 4.14: Pole vault
The rules require that athletes do not move their hands
along the pole. As per technique, they begin clearing the bar
with their feet first in a position so that the stomach faces
the bar. As with high jumping, vaulters may touch the bar, 45
as long as it doesn’t fall. Round-by-round scoring rules are
the same as for the high jump.
Throwing events
There are four major throwing events: Shot Put (putting
the shot), Discus, Javelin and Hammer Throw. These are
detailed below.
Fig. 4.15: Shot Put
1. Shot Put: In putting the shot event the athletes put a
metal ball through the air for maximum distance. For
male athletes, the metal ball weights 7.26 kg and for
female athletes the weight is 4 kg. The athlete must
stay in a circle of 2.135 m (7 ft) diameter until the shot
has landed after throw. The put must be made from the
shoulder with one arm only, and the shot must not be
brought behind the shoulder. In shot put the athlete
holds the shot close to their neck in one hand. Then
they move in straight line or spin around for gaining

The javelin must be thrown in a specific way for it to be a
legal throw. The athlete has to hold the javelin by its grip,
throw the javelin overhand and cannot turn the back to
the target when throwing. When throwing the javelin,
the athlete runs down a runway to gain momentum and
then must throw the javelin prior to crossing a line. The
athlete cannot go over the line until the javelin lands. To
avoid foul, the athlete must have a really good balance at
the end of the throw. The athlete must leave the runway
from behind the extended lines of the throwing arc.
47
Fig. 4.18: Hammer throw
4. Hammer Throw: The hammer throw doesn’t actually
involve throwing a hammer like you would think.
In this throwing event the athletes throw a heavy
ball (7.265 Kg for men and 4 Kg for women) that is
attached to a handle with a long (4 feet) wire. Like the
discus and the shot put, the athlete must stay in a
circle until the hammer lands. They spin several times
to gain momentum prior to releasing the hammer.
Balance is important due to the force generated by
having the heavy ball at the end of the long wire.
Rules for field events
In general, most field events allow an athlete to take their
attempt individually, under the same conditions as the
other athletes. Each attempt is measured to determine who
achieved the longest distance or maximum height.
• Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) must be
initiated from behind a line. In the case of throws, that
line is an arc or inside a circle. Crossing the line while
initiating the attempt will invalidate the attempt. It will
be considered as a foul.

• All landings must occur inside the area called safe.
For the jumps, it is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a
defined sector.
• A throw landing on the line, on the edge of sector, is
a foul.

• A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a
jump. However, that would not improve their position
in the standings.
• After all competitors have cleared, passed or failed their
attempts at a height, the bar height will be raised.
• The height of the bar raised is predetermined before the
competition. Though when one competitor remains,
that competitor may choose their own selected height
for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each
attempt by each competitor.
• After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one
who jumps the highest height is the winner. The bar
does not shift to a lower height except to break a tie
48 for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical
positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers,
all tied competitors will take a fourth jump at the last
height.
• If they still miss, the bar will go down one increment
where they will again jump. This process will continue
