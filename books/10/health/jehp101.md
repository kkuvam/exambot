Physical education (PE) aims at the optimum development
of an individual through continuous process of learning and
participation in guided physical activities. In other words, it
aims at optimum physical, mental and social development of
an individual.
What is Physical Education?
According to Webster’s Dictionary, “Physical education is a
part of education which gives instructions in the development
and care of the body rending from simple callisthenic exercises
to a course of study providing training in hygiene, gymnastics,
and the performance and management of athletics and
games.” Central Advisory Board of Physical Education and
Recreation defines PE as “an education through physical
activities for the development of total personality of the
child to its fullness and perfection in body, mind and spirit.
Physical education is an area through which sports, outdoor
activities like trekking, hiking, camping, gymnastics, dance,
aquatics are used to train individuals in motor skills and
fitness skills. Physical education also assists the schools in
carrying out responsibility of developing personal and social
skills in students.” In fact, PE is an integral part of total
education. It makes significant contribution towards the
achievement of desirable educational and health outcomes.
It also enables children to acquire necessary knowledge and
skills to stimulate them to actively participate in physical
activities throughout their lifespan.

students get stimulated to face challenges and are
encouraged to think productively. This tends to improve
their concentration of academic achievement.
Develops skills and experiences
Various activities learned during school days such as
gymnastics, running, jumping, throwing, swimming,
playing team games, learning the rules and regulations of
the games and being disciplined help students to develop
sportspersonship.
Positive self-image
Participation in regular physical activities also helps students
to understand the need for appreciation of own positive
aspects and develop ability to compete and cooperate with
others. Self belief is also reinforced.

objEctivEs of Physical Education
Broadly, there are four objectives of Physical Education
which are as follows.
Physical fitness
It refers to the state where an individual is physically fit and
has developed great endurance, speed and strength. Physical
fitness is essential for leading a happy, healthy, vigorous and
fulfilling life. Physical and motor fitness helps to learn and
develop technical and tactical knowledge of sports and games.

Social efficiency
It is concerned with one’s adaptation to group living. Physical
education activities provide ample opportunities to develop such
traits and life skills as cooperation, respect for others, loyalty,
sportspersonship, self-confidence, etc. All these qualities help
a person to become more social and a responsible citizen.
Sports culture
It aims at developing an understanding and appreciation of
one’s own local environment as well as the global environment.
By participating in various physical activities, such as,
dance, sports, games and yoga, a person fully understands
the history, culture, traditions, etc., and also the aesthetic
values associated with these activities.
Mental efficiency
In physical education, a child has to participate in a number 3
of physical and yogic activities. These activities not only
require involvement of the body but also require use of the
intellect to carry out the task. Positive, healthy and active
body-mind relationship helps to enhance mental efficiency.

1. What is Coronavirus?
Covid 19 is the infectious disease caused by the recently discovered coronavirus. This
new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in
December 2019. That is why it is called the Novel (new) Coronavirus (NCoV).
2. What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of Coronavirus are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.
Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become
infected but don’t develop any symptoms and dont’t feel unwell. Most people (about
80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever
cough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention immediately.
3. How does Coronavirus spread?
People can catch Coronavirus from others who have the virus. The disease can
spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
are spread when a person with Coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets land
on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch Coronavirus
by first touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
People can also catch Coronavirus if they breathe in from a person with Coronavirus
who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than
1 meter away from a person who is sick.
4. How to prevent Coronavirus?

These are principles and characteristics of sports training,
methods of sports training, training load, warming up,
cooling down, aerobic and anaerobic activities, calisthenics
and rhythmic exercises, specific training program for
development of various motor qualities, techniques, tactics
and talent identification. It is also important to understand
the difference between play, games and sports.
Play, GamEs and sPort
Though these terms are used interchangeably, these are
actually different. 5
Play
Play is spontaneous. It is usually a creative activity but has
its own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun
and pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes
both games and sports. The distinctive features of play are
that they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules
and creative.
Games

A game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A
person who participates in a game is known as a player.
Sport
A sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set
of rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination
of these. Sport are the kind of activities in which similar
kind of body movement is repeated over a long time. For
example, swimming and running and almost all the track
and field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity
or activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson
are judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual
who determines the outcome. A person participating in a
sport is called an athlete or a sportsperson.

Health and Physical Education (HPE) classes provide space
for exploring new ideas related to personal and community
health. These ideas might then be used by students in various
other fields of learning, such as, arts, science, civics and
citizenship, communication, design, creativity and technology
and languages (english, hindi and other regional languages),
humanities (e.g. history, geography, economics, etc.),
information and communication technology and psychology.
Art
Health and physical education teachers can incorporate
activities related to performing arts, drawing, painting,
dance, drama, media, music and visual communication into
their programs. These involve both fine motor skills and
whole body movement including rhythmic movement. As
body movements are part of both arts practice and health
and physical education, these promote health knowledge,
understanding of the body and lead to physical fitness and
enhancing of creative skills at the same time.
Science
The human body is a common concern of both science and
health and physical education. In science, students study the
human body from the cellular level to the systems level, with
a focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical
education learning is focused on the requirements for good
health and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain
an understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities
in ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the
musculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems
studied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social,
mental and emotional health of individuals within a society.
Students consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss
6
and adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety
and well-being, as well as to the safety and well-being of
others. It also contributes in the designing of training for
movements of organs to achieve optimal performance in the
area of play, sports and games.
Social science
Social sciences promote the idea that citizens require
knowledge and understanding of civic institutions and the
skills and willingness to actively participate in functioning
of the society. Similarly, in health and physical education,

the importance of personal identity within a community,
what makes a community and how to engage with different
