Our ancient scriptures give great emphasis on safe and sound
life. Rigveda says, “Self preservation is the first law of nature.”
Thus, safety and security should be our primary concern.
However, injuries and accidents cannot be predicted. These
may occur anywhere and anytime. If they are not managed
properly, they may have consequences like physical or
mental disability. Therefore, they need to be prevented and
managed properly. We try to minimise accidents with the
help of safety measures. In this chapter we will be learning
about precautions to keep ourselves safe and secure. First
aid is essential before advanced medical care is available.
Drug or substance abuse and its effects and prevention are
also discussed in this chapter.
Safety at the Work Place
Many injuries and accidents are reported at work place as
well as in playfield. Factors like congested space, faulty
equipments, improper methodology and carelessness cause
these. For example, while working with chemicals in chemistry
laboratory, working with equipment in physics laboratory or
on playground, one needs to be careful. Every action (with or
without equipment) govern with proper rules and methodology
which are helpful to minimise chances of accidents.
Safety while working with machines
Machines, whether hand operated or automatic, make
life easy and comfortable. But they may be the cause of
physical injuries and accidents if not handled carefully.
There are certain dos and don’ts for safety while working on
machines —
• Wash hands to remove oil and grease or use chalk
powder for proper handling.
• Avoid wearing loose clothes. They can get entangled
with machines.

the recommended dose. Thus, it is important to take the
medicines only under medical supervision.
Precautions while taking medicines
Medicines need to be used in the required dose so that they
should not only have the desired effect but also prevent
undesired side effects. Some of the precautions while taking
medicines are —
• Take medicines only if prescribed by a doctor. Self
medication may be dangerous.
• Take the recommended dose of the medicine and at
the prescribed interval. Only then there will be desired
effects. One should never adjust the dose oneself.

• Do not take any medicine on an empty stomach unless

• Keep a list of medicines one is allergic to. Always tell
the doctor about such medicine(s).
• Always visit the doctor if one experiences any unusual
symptom while taking the prescribed medicines.
• It is important that the medicine should be taken
regularly for the entire period and duration as prescribed
by the doctor. Otherwise the disease due to infections

SubStance (drug) abuSe
In an effort to establish their identity and desire for
experimentation, adolescents often try out new things.
Also they are more amenable to external influences, such
as, the media and peers. This makes them more vulnerable
to substance misuse, especially when they do not have
correct and scientific information. They also lack life skills
to deal with the wide ranging negative outcomes of extreme
dependency on a substance and thereby, getting addicted
to it.

What is substance abuse?
As you have learnt, drugs affect the body by changing
the mental and physical status of a person. Some other
substances also work in the same way and are not necessarily
drugs. The non-medical use of a substance including drugs,
that changes an individual’s mental and physical status and
affect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse.
Once a person starts using a substance, his mental state
is altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The
extreme dependency on the substance compels them to
increase the intake every day. This is called addiction.
Substance misuse is widespread today including
adolescents across the world. Socially acceptable drugs
like tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the
individual but can also influence them to associated with
crime and violence.
Commonly abused substances
There are substances that can be abused for their mood-
altering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other
hand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood-
altering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids.
They are abused by the adolescents and youth during body
building, to look more muscular.
Commonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue,
correction ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine,
cocaine and ecstasy. There are other substances like gutka
and paan (betel).
These substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk,
chewed or injected by a syringe in the blood. Some of these
substances make one addicted, even if taken once.
Reasons for substance abuse in young people
Young people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to
the following reasons —
• During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low
188
achievement at school, performance pressures, etc,.
are some of the factors that promote substance abuse
in adolescence. Resorting to substance use as a means
of ‘growing up’ or fun also makes the adolescents more
vulnerable to substance abuse.
• Pressure from peers or friends to try an addictive
substance, the urge to gain popularity among friends,
and desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new
things also make young people particularly vulnerable
to substance abuse.

• Previous experience of taking substance.
• Family history of substance misuse.
• Lack of support from family, friends and school.
• Lack of knowledge about the effects and dangers of
consuming addictive substances.
• Glamorising substance misuse by media misleads
young people.
• Easy availability of substances and drugs are the main
reasons for substance misuse in young people.
• Social approval of substance abuse like tobacco, paan,

substances.

them. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress
and help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides
to follow his friends’ advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or
two everyday. Without realising, over a period of six months
he was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a

Consequences of substance abuse
Substance misuse leads to a number of short-term and long-
term effects that are detrimental to health.
Short-term effects: These are effects that appear only
a few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels
a false sense of well-being and a pleasant drowsiness.
Some of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing
and coordination, impaired judgment, bad breath and
hangovers.

Long-term effects: Substances having a long-term
impact lead to serious damage due to constant and excessive
use. These effects show up over a course of time and are
usually caused by progressive damage to different body
organs. Some of the health consequences include irregular
eating habits, sleep disorders, poor hygiene resulting in
poor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance
abuser to diseases and infections.
Substance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or
STDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage
in risk-behaviours that make them more susceptible to
these infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more
prone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise
needles and share needles to inject the drug.
Substance users may even die suddenly from a so-called

to the organs of the body.
These substances are especially harmful if consumed
during pregnancy. These substances reach the foetus
through blood and harm it by crippling its growth and
development or death.
Substance abuse influences not only the individual
and family but also the community. The persons who get
addicted often lose interest in other activities be it school,
job or any other responsibility. They are not able to take
care of their responsibilities and may become a liability
for their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is
expensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis.
Hence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced
to engage in petty severe crimes.
Prevention of drug abuse
Paying attention to the following may prevent young people
from misusing substances —
• Peer pressure can be managed by being aware of
the implications of substance abuse and developing
190
life skills. One can not only save oneself from
adopting risky behaviours under peer pressure but
also persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy
behaviours such as substance misuse. Advocacy
with the involvement of local community can be quite
useful.
• The different ways of dealing with negative peer
pressure are saying ‘No’ assertively, making an
excuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons.
• Young people should also be educated to recognise
that a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks

after the welfare of their friends rather than force and
initiate into unhealthy habits.
• Young people should be empowered with life skills to
know about their body and their life. They should be
taking well-informed and responsible decisions.
• The family and society should provide the support
system for young children in their ‘low’ times.
• As the attitudes related to smoking, drinking and
misuse of other substances are formed during
pre-adolescence and early adolescence, this is an
important age to invest in prevention efforts. The
family, community and educational institutions
should empower young people with correct and
scientific information.
Young children should be encouraged to get engaged
in socially productive activities. For example, one can
start a learning centre for the lesser advantaged children 191
in the neighbourhood, one can learn Braille and help at
blind school, and one can create awareness about water
conservation in the neighbourhood. This will help them to
channelise their energy, being away from the menace of
substance abuse and also inculcate social responsibility
