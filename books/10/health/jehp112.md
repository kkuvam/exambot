You have already learnt that, ‘Health is a state of complete
well-being and includes physical, mental, emotional and
social health, Many animals show remarkable social behavior.
Humans too are social animals and much of their behaviour
is based on social norms laid down by the human societies
since time immemorial.
Therefore, social health is a very important issue for
all human beings — men-women, young-old, educated-
uneducated, rich-poor. Those children who learn to become
socially healthy remain so all their lives. This chapter, will deal
with the ways and means of growing up as socially healthy
individuals and also helping them to clarify myths related to
coronavirus.
Myths and facts related to coronavirus
Statement: A person with coronavirus can recover fully and not
be infectious any longer.
Fact: 80 per cent of the people have recovered from the disease
without needing special treatment. But information on the virus
treatment is still being researched.
Statement: Eating raw garlic, sesame seeds will protect you
against the virus.
Fact: Garlic is a healthy food that has other benefits but does
not protect you against the coronavirus.
Statement: The virus can die easily once it is out of the body.
Fact: We do not know about this particular virus as of now.
Similar viruses (SARS, MERS) survive from 8 to 24 hours
depending on types of surfaces.
Statement: You can get COVID-19 through mosquito bites
Fact: The coronavirus cannot be spread through the bite of a

What is social health?
Activity 12.1
Read the following conversation between an old grandfather, Mr.
Das and 12-year-old grandson’s friend Ravi.
Mr. Das : How are you Ravi and how is your grandfather?
Ravi : I am fine but my grandfather always feels angry and
unhappy. He criticises everyone all the time, so no
one wants to sit and talk with him. He is boring and
not as loving as you are. Why does he behave like
that Dadu?
Mr. Das : It is because he has been unwell for a long time. Your
grandpa is not getting company from any one, this
makes him feel lonely and isolated. In other words,
he is suffering physically, as well as mentally due to
his old age. He gets angry because he is unsure of
himself now and annoys others by his comments. He
does not think that he is acceptable in society now.
Which is why, he expresses his frustrations by being
rude to others without any reason and fault of theirs.
Why don’t you spend time with him? Talk to him
about your friends, your day in school, a happy
incident, a sad one also and you may observe the
change in him within a few days.
Ravi : Thank you, Dadu. Now I understand that if someone
is sick and emotionally unhappy, he would likely be
angry and alienate others.
Answer in brief
1. Give reasons for the loneliness of Ravi’s grandfather.
2. State situations that made Ravi think his grandfather
was alienating others.
3. Say yes or no
(a) Do you agree that physical, mental and social health
are interrelated?
(b) Living with others harmoniously requires a person
to be socially healthy. State the reason for your
choice.

Activity 12.2
• You are in a tricky situation. Your best friend had a fight with
another friend and you have seen that your best friend is at
fault. You are asked to intervene to bring back peace. Will you
announce that the cause of the fight was your best friend?
This may become a source of annoyance to your best friend
but if you did, that is Justice.
• If you help, the two boys become friends again, that is
fraternity.

Everyone is a member of a social group and everyone
is part of their peer group, family and kin, community,
city, region and country, as well as the physical and
biological environment. Would you agree that the country’s
constitution provides for Justice, Liberty, Equality and
Fraternity which should be adopted in life for living happily
and having consideration for all others in the group? Let us
understand these four terms of our constitution which are
directly related to “social health of a person or a country”,
and then try to define social health. In other words, if one is
socially healthy, than will be able to develop interpersonal
relations, through maintaining equality, fraternity and
justice.
Let us now try and define social health.
Definition of ‘social health’
Social health may be defined as the ability to form satisfying
interpersonal relationships with others. One who is able to
make positive relationships and acquires the ability to adapt
in different social situations and act appropriately as per
the situation concerned, and can be called a socially healthy
person.
Need for developing social health
Primitive humans were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small
groups or clusters and spent their lives at individual levels.
Around 10,000 years ago, they moved near rivers to grow
their own food and began to live together. With the passage
of time, they started to live in a society and developed a
language for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’
progressed, an individual became part of many social groups
for example a member of a peer group, a family and kin, a class
in school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country.
Social changes occur from time to time and many societies
lay down norms and values for group living. Urbanisation
has brought about many changes which are different from
208 traditional rural societies.
Social attributes, of people however, remain the same
as they are based on interrelationship between members of
any society and necessary for accomplishing tasks requiring
teamwork. School is one of the platforms for learning social
skills.
Role of vaRious institutions
Promotion of social health among children requires collective
efforts and appropriate skills. All people in the field of
education have to think about this.

Role of teacher training institutes and other
organisations
School teachers need a degree, diploma or certificates from a
teacher training institute. There are a number of organisation
concerned with school education. The syllabus of teacher
training courses should include the topics of important
issues for children of which health should be one.
Organisations such as NCERT, SCERT, DIET should
periodically organise workshops, publish journals and
provide inservice training programmes on health issues
including social health.
Role of schools in promoting social health
Schools have a very significant role to play in the promotion
of health and safety of children. They spend a lot of time
in school in early years. School environment forms ideal
209
setting for acquiring knowledge of healthy choices of food. It
is in school that they participate in physical activity through
sports, games, yoga, gymnastics, exercise and gain benefits
of each. School helps children to learn social skills which
assist in establishing lifelong healthy behavior. Children
learn team spirit and training in rules and regulations of
social wellbeing just as in the defense services, which are
inbuilt in training of defense service personnel, so they work
together as a team to protect our nation.
In order to promote social health, the school should
have a positive environment where children mingle with
teachers, peer group and non-teaching staff without fear and
apprehensions. Teacher have a significant role in this regard.
Role of teachers
It is well known that teachers are the mentors and therefore,
the teacher training institutes should make training in
leadership and mentorship a part of teacher training. Also well
known saying that ‘example in better than precept’ Students
easily learn to be socially healthy if the teacher herself or
himself sets an example rather than lecture on social health.
A good teacher ensures that students grow up into physically,
mentally and socially healthy individuals. In doing this the
teacher has to make efforts to ensure that students —
(i) eat a proper diet and perform regular exercise and
physical activity which are requirements of good
physical health.
(ii) inculcate friendship between classmates, indulge
in amicable behavior with others in school so that
students develop a helpful nature. These are necessary
for mental and emotional health.

3. Teachers should train students in learning life skills
like —
a) empathy and self awareness
b) effective communication so that they develop
healthy Interpersonal relationships
c) problem-solving and decision-making to learn to
be stress free
d) creative and critical thinking
e) coping with stress and emotion.
The above are absolutely essential for developing social
skills in order to be socially healthy.
Social skills help a student to have a desirable self image
and self esteem and also self confidence. This makes children
acquire ability to live harmoniously in the society.
Role of technology in building social health
Technology has made communication convenient through
Mobiles, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and E-mail
messages. Knowledge about different media can help to
develop the skills to access the appropriate media for
accurate information on a specific topic or issues. More
so, because media brings awareness, and provides access
to global knowledge and learning. But refrain from using
mobiles and viewing the T.V. for long periods as that tends
to be counter-productive and reduce interaction time with
others. This makes us socially withdrawn. Although media is
a source of information, all of it may not be true or reliable.
It is advisable to seek guidenes from a trusted adult while
accessing media and internet. Moreover, there is a need to
understand about real and fake news or information as these
affects our attitude and behavior.
Role of students in building habits of social health
Social health comes from social skills. A few important
guidelines for promoting social skills are outlined below.
(i) Building self awareness is an important skill: Practice
self-care by developing habits of cleanliness and
210
hygiene, keeping away from substance abuse,
engaging in physical activity and regularly consuming
a balanced diet.
(ii) Do not be blameful and judgmental: Remember when
you point a finger at others, three fingers of yours
point towards you. Hence indulge in knowing yourself
better. It helps to discriminate between a good
and a bad act of yours and helps to make friends.
Empathy and self awareness go hand in hand.

child that if they were hit, they would feel the same
pain. That is empathy for others and leads to self
awareness.
(iii) Learn to identify your own mistakes: There is no harm
in saying sorry for a mistake and rectifying it. People
will have faith in you if you did so.
(iv) Make an effort to reconnect with old relationships and
friendships: The socially healthy person makes an
effort to contact and meet old friends, to remember
enjoyable periods of childhood which can be a good
way to beat stress and spend leisure time.
(v) Appreciate yourself and others: But never let your ego
rule your behaviour which can sometimes drive you
to lose a relationship.
(vi) Try and be respectful, positive and supportive towards
the needy, the physically and mentally challenged, the
211
downtrodden and those belonging to faith and cultures
other than yours. Lend an ear to others opinion. It
teaches tolerance. Tolerance and appreciation are
virtues in socially healthy individuals.
Role of family in inculcating social skills in young
family members
The importance of family in inculcating social skills among,
children is paramount. Guardians or parents are the prime
teachers and caretakers who feed them healthy food and are
also their play mates. They have to be aware themselves to
be role model and make children appreciate as they grow.
The benefits of enjoying nutritious food and being aware
of a balanced diet is of paramount importance. Watching
of television for longer duration is bad for students.
Parents themselves have to be cautious in what they do
in front of children and how long they are in front of the
TV. However, at the same time good TV programmes are
an avenue for learning. Encourage them to indulge in
physical activity to build their muscles and bones. Fit body
and fitness depends primarily on proper diet and healthy
body and mind. The parents and elder family members
need to guide them in social skills. Parents and elders
have to be accessible to children for necessary guidance.
They form a “safety network’. They are to guide adolescents
through advice, answer their queries and occupy them
through activities to keep them away from involvement
in addictive substances like tobacco, drugs and alcohol
which they might believe are helpful in tiding over stress.
However, these substances have deleterious effects on the
growing body.

1. The teacher needs to play an active role in discouraging
her students from engaging in socially unhealthy
practices such as vindictive attitudes, selfishness,
jealousy and culture of hatred. For this, teacher has
to sacrifice time and energy. It is however, necessary
for a teacher and school authorities to understand
that more than finishing the syllabus and passing
exams, it is the teacher’s responsibility to build good
human beings. Home has a large role to play but
it has been the mission of teachers to contribute
towards grooming students into socially healthy
adults
2. Another role of a teacher in inculcating ‘social health’
212
is to have a friendly, stress-free atmosphere in class.
This can happen if students are engaged in ‘group
activities’, especially activities for ‘experiential
learning’. Members of groups are reshuffled from
time to time for team activities so that students
may understand that it takes all kinds of people to
make the world and the socially healthy groups can
live in harmony despite differing in opinions. Group
activities build team spirit and remove boredom.
