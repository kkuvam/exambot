A team game means organised physical activity with players
working together towards a shared objective. In team games
a group of individuals in the same team, work together to
achieve the objective of being the winners of the game. Team
members set points and scores, make decisions, communicate
among themselves, manage conflicting situations, and solve
problems in a supportive, trusting atmosphere in order to
achieve their objectives. Team games include games, such
as, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Kabaddi,
Kho-Kho and Volleyball, etc. In this chapter, we shall discuss
Basketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey and Volleyball.

five players on each team. They play on a marked rectangular
court with a basket fixed on each end. Basketball is one of
the world’s most popular games.
The rules allow all players to move freely around the
court and occupy any position. All players have an equal
opportunity to score a Basket. To play basketball, students
should learn and practice the basic skills of dribbling,
passing, receiving and shooting.
History
The game of basketball originated at the Springfield
College of Physical Education, Massachusetts, USA in
1891, invented by Dr. James Naismith. In 1894, Naismith
fixed the first 13 rules which still form the basis of
modern basketball. In India, the Young Men’s Christian
Association (YMCA) at Kolkata introduced basketball for
the first time. Later the YMCA established at Madras
in 1920 played an important role in the development of
this game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite
games in many schools and colleges. The game is played
by both men and women of all ages and ability. In order
to promote Basketball at National and International levels
the Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950. The
first National Basketball tournament was held in Delhi in
1934 and thereafter it was organised every two years until
1951. After that it started being organised annually.

into two sections, called half-courts, by the mid-court line,
which is where the game starts with a jump ball. A jump
ball is when a referee throws the ball up at center circle to
determine which team gets possession. Two players from
opposing teams jump up to tap the ball out of the circle in
order to gain control over the ball take the game forward. The
basketball posts are located at the opposite ends of the court.

only five players from each team may be on the court
at one time. Substitutions are unlimited but can only
be done when the play is stopped.
• The team with the ball, attempting to score in
their basket is ‘on offense’, the team that prevents
opposite team from scoring is ‘on defence’. The ball is
moved in two ways: either dribbling or by passing to
teammates. If the ball goes out of the court, the ball
possession is given to the opposite team.
• For both men’s and women’s teams, a standard
uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey
with a clearly visible bib number, printed on both
the front and back. Players should wear appropriate
shoes that provide extra ankle support.
• The game is controlled by the officials consisting
of the three (3) referees, out of which one (1) is the
overall incharge and the other four (4) table officials
are responsible for keeping other records of each

Players who are fouled either get ball possession or
are awarded one or two free throws and one point
is awarded for successfully converting a free throw,
which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from
the basket. Each player is allowed 5 personal fouls
before they are disqualified from the game. At this
point they no longer remain a part of the game.
• Two points are awarded when a basket is scored
during the game but three points are awarded when
a basket is scored from outside the 6.25 mtrs line.
Fundamental skills
We are well aware that, to play any game one has to learn
some skills. Similarly to play basketball game a player
should learn the following fundamental skills.
Dribbling
It is important to penetrate to score a basket, move the
ball across the court, get away from the defenders, and
find a good passing lane. There are different types of
dribbling —
• basic dribble
• low dribbling
• high dribble
• behind the back
• crossover dribble
• change-of-pace
• between the legs dribble
Passing
A good offensive attack requires accurate passing from
players. It helps find an open man, to find a good shooter

Defence
Fig. 6.6: Defence
The game of basketball allows a variety of defences to be
deployed in an effort to disrupt and combat offensive
plays. Here are examples of the three basic categories of
team defences. In addition, each category comprises of an
assortment of different variations.
• Man to man defence: Man-to-man defences match
up the defenders against specific offensive players.
Defenders are usually assigned to be matched up with
offensive players by size and ability.
• Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned
to guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named
or designated by their player alignments.
• Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be
deployed is the combination defence. With combina-
tion defences, some of the players are assigned to play
man-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone.
Combination defences are usually deployed in an effort
to stop or neutralise great individual offensive players.
Rebounding
82
The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession
of the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it
rebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role
in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses
a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive
rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side
and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds,
in which the defending team gains possession of the loose
ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team
on defence tends to be in better position to recover missed
shots.

Introduction
Cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams
on a field, at the centre of which is a rectangular pitch. One
team bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many
runs as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to
dismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by
the batting team. A run is scored by the striking batsman
hitting the ball with his bat, running to the opposite end
of the pitch and touching the crease there without being
dismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at
the end of an inning.

History
The game of cricket, as it is played today, has its origin in the
south eastern part of England. Cricket became a generally
adopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century.
The Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s
had played a significant part in the evolution of the game.
It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C)
with its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became
an international game with the formation of the Imperial
Cricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial
Cricket Conference was changed to International Cricket
Conference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the
common wealth to become its members. The first Limited
Over International cricket match was played in 1971 at
Melbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC)
saw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket
World Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket
world cup won by West Indies.
In the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20,
has made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international
match took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s
teams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20
international match between men’s teams was played on
February 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The
first T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007.
India won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.
An all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under
Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket
Control Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The
national championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935.
India entered the international arena and played its first official
Test against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji
of Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies,
made a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket.

Ways to score runs
The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main
cricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must
run to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the
other), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they
may run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running
they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman
hits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both
are scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary
after touching the ground it is considered as four and if
the ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is
considered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6
has been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman
by running between the wickets are null and void.
Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket
rules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket
rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded 85
to the batting team but not the individual batters.
• A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the
heel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of
the popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches
then outside the return crease the ball is declared no
ball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place,
the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when
bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces
more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman
or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The
batsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but
cannot be out from a No ball except if they are run
out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the
field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no
ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for
the no ball itself.
• A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the
batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to
score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled
over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide
but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide
deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being
much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will
add one run to the batting team and any runs scored
by the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be
declared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are
stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or
obstruct the field.
• A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes
the striking batsman and runs are scored without the
batsman hitting the ball.

• A Leg Bye is where runs are scored by hitting the
batsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball
or wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking
batsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was
avoiding the ball.
Types of ‘out’ in cricket
Ways batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules:
There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given
out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman
out it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the
different ways, a batsman can be given out according to the
rules of cricket:
Fig. 6.9: Bowled
• Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled
and hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is
given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the
ball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched
the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of
the batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have
touched another player or umpire before hitting the
wickets.
86
• Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman while
playing the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove
holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out.
This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler
catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this
is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.
• Leg before Wicket (LBW) – If the ball is bowled and
hits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then
an LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to
give this out he must first look at some of the factors
stated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire

I
need to decide is that if is not a no ball, would the ball
have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his,
answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on
the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman
out. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the
line of off stump while he was attempting to play a
stroke then he is not out.
• Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to
cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his
wicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting
a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).
• Retired Out – A batsman leaves the field without the
permission of umpire for any resource like, illness,
injury etc. Than is given as retired out.
• Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out
if no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the
87
popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket
is fairly put down by the fielding side.
• Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman
hits his wicket down with his bat or body after the
bowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in
play then he is out.
• Handled the Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman
to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the
hand that is not touching the bat without the consent
of the opposition or umpire.
• Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to
face a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner
within three minutes of the outgoing batsman being
dismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman
can be given timed out.
• Hit the Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a
batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose
of protecting his wicket or with consent from the
opposition, he is out.
• Obstructing the Field – A batsman is out if he
intentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action
There are many other cricket rules. However these are
most of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing
the game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be
learned along the way and are not vital to general play.
If any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s
consent for any reason other than injury or incapacity,
he may resume the innings only with the consent of the
opposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out.
For the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out
is considered a dismissal.

Rules
• Cricket is a game played between two teams consisting
of eleven players each. There is also a reserve player
called a twelfth man, who can only be utilized as fielder.
• The twelfth man is not allowed to ball, bat, and wicket
keeping or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as
a substitute fielder.
• Two umpires are placed on the playing field while there
is also a third umpire off the field who is in charge of
video decisions.
• When the call is too close for the on field umpires
then they refer it to the third umpire who reviews slow
motion video replays to make a decision.

Batting techniques
• Defence • Drive
• Pull • Cut
• Hook • Sweep
Front foot defence
• The front foot defence is played when the ball is bowled
at a good length, which is not over-pitched enough for
a drive and not short enough to go on the back foot.
• The front foot should move as close as possible to
the pitch of the ball with the left shoulder and left
elbow leading the body in the direction of the ball.
• The weight of the body is on the front foot with
the knee bent and the head should be over the bat
watching the point of contact. The bat is kept angled
and very close to the front pad to prevent the ball
89
going through bat and pad.
• The top hand is firm at the top of the handle while the
bottom hand is relaxed, with the thumb and index
finger loosely holding the bat. The back leg should
be fully extended with the heel raised off the ground
but remaining parallel to the crease.
• The weight of the back foot should be on the inside
of the right toe and care should be taken not to turn
it or drag it out of the crease.
• The front foot defensive stroke can be played with
the bat slightly behind or in front of the pad depend-
ing on the nature of the wicket and the proficiency
of the bowler.
Off drive
• Off drive is played to an over-pitched ball in line with
the off stump or marginally outside.
• Like the forward defence, the left shoulder and elbow
lead the body with the front foot going as close as
possible to the pitch of the ball. The bat comes down
in and arc from the top of the back lift and strikes the
ball just in front of the left foot.
• After impact, the bat must continue in the arc and finish
over the left shoulder. The follow through can also be
checked at shoulder height, keeping the bat face open.
• The head is kept straight and still throughout the shot
and the top hand and elbow controls the direction of
the shot. At the time of impact the head should be
over the ball with the body weight balanced on the
front foot. The full face of the bat must hit the ball and
on completion, the batsman must be well balanced.

Straight drive
• This shot is played exactly in the same way as an off
drive but with the difference is that it is played to a over
pitched ball in and around the line of middle stump
and the front foot must point down the wicket and the
body must be turned slightly and the shoulders opened
out to allow the free swing of the bat.
On drive
• On drive is played to a over-pitched ball on and around
the leg stump.
• This has been considered to be a difficult shot to play.
The basic principles of a drive apply here too, though
the swing of the bat is an arc from slips to mid- on
with the front pointing down the wicket.
• The front foot should be placed outside the line of ball
with the shoulders turned and the impact is just in
front of the left toe. The follow through is generally
checked below shoulder height.
Back foot defence
• The back foot defensive stroke is played to a short-
pitched ball in line with the stumps, which is not
short enough to play and attacking shot.
• The back foot is moved back and across to the line
of the ball with the front naturally following it. The
bat is brought down close to the body with the head
steady and over the ball.
• The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as
far as possible to maintain the sideways position of
the body with the top hand firm and in control, and
the bottom hand holding the bat loosely.
• To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high
next to the head. Care should be taken to maintain
Fig. 6.11: Bowling Skills the balance at the time of playing the ball and to
90 remain ‘side-on’ as this presents a smaller target for
short rising deliveries.
• The back foot defence can also be played with the
body beside the line of the ball, but here the batsman
must resist the temptation to follow the movement of
the ball away from him.
Bowling skills
Bowling is as important as batting. The ball is defended by
a batsman to save his wicket. When the ball is bowled to a
batsman it is called as a ball or delivery.

Swing bowling
• When a ball of a fast or medium fast bowler deviator in
air either on leg side (in swing) or on off side (out swing)
91
it is turned in air as swing bowling.
Outswing
• For out swing bowling, the ball is held with the index
and middle finger and thumb below the seam, which
is upright & angled towards the slips with the shiny
surface on the right (for right hand bowler).
• For effective out swing bowling, the bowler should bowl
as close as possible to the stumps.
• The wrist is cocked and when the ball is released the
seam must be vertical and goes down the pitch upright.
The two fingers should stay behind the seam as long as
possible.
Inswing
• Here, the ball is held by the two fingers and the thumb
underneath it, with the seam upright and angle towards
fine leg.
• The shiny side is on the left side and the fingers may
also have a slight gap between them.
Wicket keeping
The wicket keeper plays an important role in cricket.
Fig. 6.12: Wicket keeping
A good wicket keeper can save a number of runs for his team.
His function is to stop deliveries, which the batsman is
unable to play or passed by batsman.
Fielding
In 21st century, fielding is a key point to win the match.
A player requires more hard work, practice and flexibility to
become a good fielder.

FootBall
Football has been a very popular game all over the world
since ages. Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game
that involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point.
93
It is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a
rectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a
goal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected
at the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the
ball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it
between two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball
by kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that
scores more points than the other by the end of the match
wins the game.
History
According to FIFA (Federation International de Football
Association), the “very earliest form of the game was played
in china during the second and third centuries. The game
was later developed in England and the rules of football were
m
formulated in India, football began its journey when the c

British rulers brought it with them and in no time it became 7

popular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place 8

between the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen
of Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India, Circumference
of football
the ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first
football association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA)
Fig. 6.14: Specifications of
was established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no football
Indian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India
Football Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is
the oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was
started in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is
known as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as
the country put up commendable performances in a number
of international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951
and 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.

Goal post
Distance between the posts is 7.32 meter whereas the height
of the goal post is 2.44 meter.
Rules
According to the official rules of football guide, the players
need to execute the game in a fair and accepted manner. The
football match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each.
There are several rules in the game of football regarding the
field, players, penalties, offence and defence.
Start and restart of play
A coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of
the toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At
the kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own
halves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot
in the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it 95
again until another player has made contact.
Punishment for offences
If the player persistently offends during a match, the referee
can choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution
is shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads
to Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means
that player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no
previous caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such
as, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately
handling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying
a goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or
gestures.
Free kicks
Whenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite
side must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it
is kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken.
There are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the
nature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team
to take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free
Kick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a
second player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to
score a goal.
Penalty kick
A penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the
penalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is
allowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the
goalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line
until the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be
outside the penalty area behind the penalty spot. After the

player has taken the kick, that player cannot strike the ball
again without another player touching the ball.
Throw-in
A throw-in is awarded when the whole ball crosses the touch
line (conceded by the team who last touched the ball). It
is delivered on the field of play with both hands and from
behind and over the player’s head. Otherwise it is deemed to
be a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It
cannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same
team). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.
Corner kick
A corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal
line of the opposition, after touching one of their players.
A kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball
travelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from
the corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second
time without having touched by any other player.
Fundamental skills
Receiving
Receiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a
ball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive
the ball, don’t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move,
shot, dribble, pass.
Passing
Passing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision
making is required before a perfect pass. Before pass,
see the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding
the head steady. Strike the correct area of the ball with
lacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of
weight forward.
Shooting
96 Shooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the
difference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to
convert the score for the team. Player should look up to see
the position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the
ball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper
follow through.
Trapping
It is a method of gaining control of the ball. Trapping uses
the feet, thigh, or chest to bring the ball to the ground.

Techniques and lead-up activities
The students already learnt the fundamental techniques of
playing football in the previous classes. Now let us discuss a
few lead-up activities to develop these techniques.
Ball control
Five versus two in 30m x 20m area. Players make two touches
only to retain possession of the ball.
Dribbling
Four quarters of the area are numbered. One player dribbles
in one quarter and passes the ball to quarter number 2
and so on. Reaching last quarter, the player without losing
the ball gets points. If ball is lost in any quarter, the other
teams start anti clockwise and then enter in to the next three
quarters.
97
Passing
Number of players—four. Rectangle measures 5m × 20m or
10m × 30 m, one ball.
Heading
Two versus two, Goal of 8 yards, Centre line 5 yards from
each goal.
Shooting
Shooting board is a place along the penalty spot, arranged
inside the penalty area.
Tackling
One versus one, 10m × 10m area, time 2 minutes.
Throw-ins
Throw-in is a competition between two players.
Goal keeper
A goal keeper also acts as a defence but is allowed to catch
or touch the ball with hands within the penalty box (D-area).
A goal keeper is usually the last man standing at the goal to
prevent opponents from scoring the goal.

HoCkey
Introduction
Field Hockey is a team game, in which a team of players
attempt to score goals by hitting/Scooping, pushing or
flicking a ball into an opposing team’s goal using curved
sticks. However, the name Field Hockey is used in countries
in which the word Hockey is generally reserved for another
form of hockey, such as ice hockey or street hockey.
The players should learn and practice the basic skills of
dribbling, passing, tapping and hitting. They should learn
how to attack and score goals and how to work with others
to defend and stop goals from being scored. To do this they
need to learn how to keep possession by dribbling effectively
and moving the ball accurately and quickly between players.
As they progress, skills should become more consistent and
efficient, and the players should be introduced to set play
situations.

History
The history of the game of hockey has its roots well laid in the
world’s early civilisations. One of the oldest known sports, the
hockey game is believed to be in existence about 1200 years
before the Ancient Games of Olympia. Right from Arabs,
Greeks, Romans, and Persians to Ethiopians, every country
played with a variation of the game. While some played it just

for recreation, the others had the opinion that hockey would
make them better warriors. Even though many ancient
civilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern
game of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the
19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army
regiments and the game soon became popular. It was during
this time that the London Hockey Association was formed
and the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924,
the International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and
three years later, the International Federation of Women’s
Hockey followed.
In India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in
1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making
its Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian
hockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding
a single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was
the wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who
99
mesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills.
From 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold
medals, while winning 24 consecutive matches. It was the
golden era of Indian hockey, when India produced some of
the finest players the game has ever seen.

Hockey is played on a 91.40 m × 55 m rectangular field.
At each end there is a goal 2.14 m high 1.20 m deep and
3.66 m wide measured from the inner sides of the posts and
crossbar, and the goal post is surrounded by an approximately
semi-circular area 14.63 m from the goal bounded by
a solid line. A spot 0.15m in diameter, called the penalty
spot, is marked with its centre 6.40 m from the centre of
each goal.
Equipment
Each player carries a stick, normally a little over 3 feet (90
centimeters) long, 2 inches wide and traditionally made
of wood but now often made with fiberglass, Kevlar and
carbon fiber composites, with a rounded handle flattening
out on one side and with a hook at the bottom.
Rules
The rules set by the International Hockey Federation FIH
are used worldwide.
General play
Prior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the
winning captain can choose a starting end or start with
the ball. The game time is divided into four quarters of 15
minutes each 15-02-15-10-15-2-15. At the start of each
quarter as well as after goals are scored, play is started
with a pass from the centre of the field.
Field players may only play the ball with the flat side
of the stick. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler
does not make contact with the attacker or his stick
before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also
be penalised if the tackle was made from a position where
contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball
may not deliberately use his body or stick to shield the
ball from a legitimate tackle.
When the ball passes over the sidelines, it is returned to
play from sideline either by individual player by himself or
with a push or hit, taken by a member of the team whose
100
players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing
the sideline. If it crosses the goal line after last touched
by an attacker, a 15 mt hit or pass can be made by any
player of the defending team. A 15 mt hit is also awarded
for offenses committed by the attacking side within
15 mt of the end, of the pitch they are attacking.
Free hits
Free hits are awarded when offences are committed outside
the scoring circles. The ball may be hit or pushed once in
any direction by the team offended against. Opponents

must move 5 mt away from the ball when a free hit is
awarded, and for attacking free hits within 5 mt of the circle,
all attackers other than the one taking the hit must also be
5 mt away.
Corner
A corner is awarded if the ball goes over the backline after
last being touched by a defender. Corners are played by
the attacking team and involve a free hit from the 22.90
meter line.
Penalty corner
The penalty corner is set play that is awarded against
a defending team when any offence is committed in the
defensive circle, and may be awarded when a deliberate
offence is committed in the defending 23 m area, or when the
defending team deliberately plays the ball over the back line. 101
Penalty stroke
A penalty stroke is awarded when defenders commit a
deliberate foul in the circle which deprives an attacker of
possession or the opportunity to play the ball. This penalty
is being taken by a single attacker against the goalkeeper,
and is taken from a spot 6.4 m from the penalty spot and
directly in front of the goal. The goalkeeper must stand with
heels on the goal line, and cannot move his feet until the ball
is played.
On the umpire’s whistle, the striker may push or flick the
ball at the goal, which the goalkeeper attempts to save. The
player taking the penalty shot may not touch the ball twice.
Hitting or dragging or tapping the ball is also forbidden. If
the shot is saved, play is restarted with 15 mt hit to the
defenders; if a goal is scored, play is restarted from the centre
line. Time is stopped for the Penalty stroke.
Dangerous play
If the ball is raised off the ground in a manner that is, in the
umpire’s opinion, dangerous, the ball is turned over to the
other team and they receive a free hit from the point of contact.
Tie breaker (shootout)
In case of a draw match, penalty shootout is conducted.
The winners will be decided by 5 penalty shootouts by each
team and the team which scores highest number of goals
is declared the winner. The shootout will start at 22.90 mt.
line in front of the shooter and should be completed within 8
seconds after the umpire’s whistle. The goalkeeper will start
defence from goal line.

VolleyBall
Volleyball is a net game that involves two teams of 12 players
(six playing and six substitutes). Each team works together
to hit an inflated ball over a high net. Each team tries to
score points by grounding the ball on the other team’s court.
Volleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch
the ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential
for the player to be in the right place at the right time if
the game is to be played in a controlled manner. Therefore,
good anticipation and movement skills should be taught
to players. At competency level, students should learn and
practice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over
a high net. They should play simple 3 touch volleyball games
working as a team to keep the ball in play and ground it on
the opponent’s side of the court.
History
Originally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor
102
sport for older players to be able to exert a bit of athletic
effort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net
was borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above
the average man’s height. During a demonstration game,
someone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying
the ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball”
would be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game
of Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year
1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts by YMCA (USA). It was
invented as a recreational game. This game was brought to
India more than 85 years ago when some physical education

NETR Posts
The net is 2.43 mt high for men and 2.24 mt high for women.
It is doubled vertically over the center line. It is 1 m wide and
9.5-10 m long end is 10 cm more bleak mesh. The antenna
is a flexible rod 1.8 m long and 10 mm. in diameter centered
fixed an side line near pole. The top on antenna extends
80 cm above the net. The 2.55 m high posts are placed
0.5 m – 1.0 m out side the side line.
Rules
Volleyball is a fast game played by two teams of 6 players
each. It can be played indoors or outdoors. A player
on one of the teams begins a ‘rally’ by serving the ball
from behind the back line of the court, over the net,
and into the receiving team’s court. The receiving team
must not let the ball be grounded within their court.
The rally continues, with each team allowed up to three
consecutive touches, until either a team grounds the ball
on the opponent’s court and wins the rally or a team
commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins
the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start
the next rally. The ball is usually played with the hands
or arms, but players can legally strike or push the ball
with any part of the body.
Common faults include —
• catching and throwing the ball;
• two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the
same player;
• four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the
same team;
• touching the net during play;
• crossing the centre line; and
• violation of rotation.
Fundamental skills and lead-up activities
104
Smash
• Run and approach as per the height, distance and
speed of the ball.
• Swing the arm back behind the body. Bend slightly
