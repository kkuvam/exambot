Track and field events, as one of the major individual sports,
have already been studied in the previous chapter. However
there are other individual sports like Badminton, Gymnastics,
Table Tennis, Tennis, Swimming and Combative Sports such
as Judo and Boxing. We shall discuss these games in this
chapter.
Badminton
Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing
players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The players
take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that
is divided by a net. It is one of the few sports where men and
women can play together. It is a game for all ages and abilities.
Although fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is
also played as a recreation game across the world.
History
The origin of the badminton dates back to second century
BC. Although it appears that this sport was named after
Badminton House, Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke
of Beaufort. In 1873, some British army officers in India
initially played the game at ‘Poonah’ (now known as Pune)
thus derived its name. In 1877 first set of rules were derived.
These laws were gradually adopted by other nations. However,
the game evolved as an international sport only after the
first All England Championship. In 1934, the International
Badminton Federation (now known as Badminton World
Federation) was formed and the rules of the game were
standardized. Badminton Association of India came into
existence in the year 1934. Various state level associations
are affiliated to it.

Events
The events played in badminton are: (a) Singles’ (Men,
Women), (b) Doubles’ (Men, Women), (c) Mixed Doubles’
(Combination of one Man and one Woman) and (d) Teams’
Event (Men, Women, Mixed)
Court
The court is rectangular, and is divided into 2 halves by a
net. Court is usually marked for both singles’ and doubles’
play. The doubles’ court is wider than the ‘singles’ court.
The full width of the court is 6.1 metres, and in singles’
this width is reduced to 5.18 metres. The full length of the
court is 13.4 metres. The service courts are marked by a
centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service
line at a distance of 1.98 metres from the net, and by the
outer side and back boundaries. In doubles’, the service
court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 53
metres from the back boundary.
The net is 1.55 metres high at the edges and 1.524 metres
high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles
sidelines, even when singles is played.

Service
• At the beginning of the game of badminton and when
the score is even, the server serves from the right
service court.
• Server and receiver always stand diagonally in opposite
service courts.
• The server’s racket shall initially hit the base of the
shuttle.
• While serving the whole of the shuttle shall be below
1.15m from the surface of the court at the instant of
impact of the racket with the shuttle.
• Some parts of both feet of the server and receiver must
remain in contact with the surface of the court until
service is delivered.
• The movement of the server’s racket must continue
forward after the start of service until service is delivered.
Let
‘Let’ is called by the umpire, or by a player (if there is no
umpire), to halt play. A ‘let’ may be given for any unforeseen
or accidental occurrence. It shall be a ‘let’, if —
• there is an unforeseen or accidental situation occurs.
• during play, the shuttle is caught in the net or caught
on the net and remains suspended on its top after
passing over the net.
• the shuttle disintegrates and the base separates from
the rest of the shuttle.
• the server and receiver are both faulted at the same
time.
• the server serves before the receiver is ready.
• the line judge is unsighted and the umpire is unable to
make a decision.
• in the opinion of the umpire, the play is disrupted or
a player of the opposing side is distracted by a coach.
54
Faults
A player or player’s side loses the rally, if the service or shuttle —
• is not correct.
• misses the shuttle during service.
• lands outside the court.
• passes through the net.
• fails to cross over the net.
• touches the walls or ceiling or ground before being
retrieved.
• is hit twice.

• hits a player, attire, equipment or any person or object
outside the court.
• is hit by both the doubles partners in succession.
• is in play, the player’s racket, parts of his body or his
clothes touch the net or its support.
Fundamental techniques
1. Grip: Holding grip of a badminton racket is the
foundation of playing this game. Holding the racket
wrongly will reduce the power and accuracy of the
stroke. The shots will be limited. A player needs to
learn how to change grip quickly during games. Below
are the two basic types of badminton grips.
Forehand grip
• This grip is used to hit shots on the forehand side of the 55
body and around the head shots.
• In this a player holds the racket head in the non-playing
hand, keeping the handle points towards the body. The
face of the racket perpendicular to the floor.
• The player places the playing hand on the handle
just like shaking hands with it, it is like a V shape in
between thumb and index finger.
• For flexibility, the racket handle rest loosely in the fingers.
• In order to increase control and accuracy while serving
and hitting from the forecourt and mid court, the grip
is shortened and placed nearer to the shaft.

Backhand grip
• While playing backhand grip, shots is hit from
backhand (left) side of player’s body.
• The player holds the racket in the same way as it was
held in forehand grip.
• The player turns the racket anti-clockwise so that the
V shape moves leftwards.
• The player places the thumb against the back of the
handle for greater leverage and power.
• The other techniques are the same as in forehand grip.

2. Service: There are basically three types of serves —
high, low and flat. High service is the most basic of
all strokes. One needs to learn this first when one
starts playing the game. You need to concentrate on
the following three broad points while delivering the
high service.
• Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has
to take a position about two feet from the short
service line and about six inches from the centre
56
line.
The player has to make sure not to touch the
centre line as it will be called a touch fault. The
player has to stand comfortably with both feet
spread apart and parallel to each other and take
the initial serving position. At this stage, the full
weight of the body is on the back foot.
• Point of Contact: As one starts the forward
movement of the racket, slowly start shifting the
weight from the back foot to the front foot. The
player then drops the shuttle and hit it high and

II
back to the baseline. The player must make sure
that the point of contact is always below the waist.
• Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the
player continues to swing the racket right across
the left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is
left-handed). This is called the follow through.
3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in
a rally because good return of serve allows a player to
dictate terms and control a rally till the point is won.
However weak return of serve will allow the opponent
to go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit
the shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the
court with the left foot forward and place the weight
of the body more on the front foot. It will help the
player to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and
flick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance
57
closer to the short service because in high serve the
shuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On
a high serve, a player has the choice of playing an
attacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash.
Similarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or
lift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try
to meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so
that the receiver has more options available to choose
the shots.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is a sport that involves physical movements
in a sequence. It requires physical strength, balance,
coordination, endurance, flexibility and body control. It
often involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other
moves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and
motor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of
precision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit
or specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well
as internationally.
History
Gymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices
by the ancient Greeks. It included skills for mounting
and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills.
The Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However,
in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the
German physical educators created exercises for boys
and young men on apparatus. Their design is considered
as modern gymnastics. The Federation of International
Gymnastics was founded in 1881. By the end of the

nineteenth century, men’s gymnastics competition was
popular enough to be included in the first “Modern” Olympic
Games in 1896 and women gymnasts were included in
Olympic Games in 1986. The first world cup in gymnastics
was organised in 1975.
Forms of gymnastics
The major forms of gymnastics are: Artistic gymnastics,
Rhythmic gymnastics, Trampolining, Tumbling and Acrobatic
Gymnastics.
Artistic gymnastics
Artistic gymnastics is usually divided into Men’s and Women’s
Gymnastics. Men compete in six events. These are floor
exercise, pommel horse, still rings/roman rings, vaulting
table, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Women compete on
four events. These are floor exercise, vaulting table, uneven
bars, and balancing beam. Fig. 5.5: Vault
1. Events for men
(i) Floor Exercise: For this event a 12×12 square
spring floor is required. A series of tumbling
passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility,
strength, and balance. The gymnast must also
show strength skills, including circles, scales, and
press handstands. Men’s floor routines usually
have four passes that will total between 50–70
seconds and are performed without music. As per
rules, male gymnasts touch each corner of the
floor at least once during their routine.
(ii) Pommel Horse: A typical pommel horse exercise
involves both single leg and double leg skills.
Single leg skills are generally found in the form of
scissors, often done on the pommels. Double leg
skill, however, is the main staple of this event.
The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion
Fig. 5.4: Pommel horse (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on
preference) and performs such skills on all parts
58 of the apparatus. Gymnasts will often include
variations on a typical circling skill by turning or
by straddling their legs. This makes the exercises
of gymnast more challenging. A gymnast performs
a dismount, either by swinging his body over the
horse or landing after a handstand.
(iii) Still Rings: The rings are attached to a wire cable
from a point to 5.75 meters from the floor, and
adjusted in height so, that the gymnast has room
to hang freely and swing. The gymnast performs a

(ii) Vault: In the vaulting events gymnasts sprint
down a 25 meters (82 ft) runway, jump onto or
perform a round off entry onto a beat board or
spring board, land momentarily, inverted on the
hands on the vaulting horse or vaulting table.
Then they spring off this platform to a two footed
landing. Every gymnast starts at a different point
on the vault runway depending on her height and
strength. The post flight segment may include one
or more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting
movements. In vaults with round-off entries,
gymnasts “round-off” so that hands are on the
runway while the feet land on the springboard.
From the round-off position the gymnast travels
backwards as in a back handspring so that the
hands land on the vaulting platform (horse).
She then blocks off the vaulting platform into
various twisting and somersaulting combinations.
(iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as
Fig. 5.7: Uneven bars asymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine
on two horizontal bars set at different heights. The
height is generally fixed, but the width may be
adjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling,
transitional, and release moves, as well as moves
that pass through the handstand. Usually in higher
levels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure
that the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and
to protect the hands from blisters and tears.
(iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a
choreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds
in length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills,
turns and dance elements on a padded spring
beam. Apparatus norms set by the International
Gymnastics Federation specify that the beam
must be 125 cm (4’) high, 500 cm (16’) long, and
Fig. 5.8: Balance beam
10 cm (4.5”) wide. The event requires in particular,
60 balance, flexibility and strength.
3. Rhythmic gymnastics
Only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics,
although there is a new version of this discipline
for men being pioneered in Japan. This combines
elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance and apparatus
manipulation. The sport involves the performance of
five separate routines with the use of five apparatus
– Ball, Ribbon, Hoop, Clubs, Rope on a floor area,
with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather
than the acrobatic.

4. Acrobatic gymnastics
Acrobatic gymnastics is one of the oldest
forms of organised physical activities,
and today it is being reorganised, revitalised by
changes and renewed interest. The International
Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) was founded
in Moscow in 1973. United States Sports Acrobatics
(USSA) was founded in 1975. It was merged with
International Gymnastics federation (FIG) in 1999.
Sports Acrobatics was demonstration sports at the
2000 Olympics in Sydney. Now, it is an accepted
competitive sport. It is very effective for the
development of physical fitness and graceful posture.
Acrobatic gymnastics is a group gymnastic discipline
for both men and women. Acrobats in groups of two,
three and four perform routines with the heads,
61
hands and feet of their partners. They may, subject to
regulations (e.g. instrumental), pick their own music.
5. Tumbling and trampolining
Tumbling, also known as power tumbling, is a
gymnastics sporting discipline which combines skills
of artistic gymnastics with those of trampolining. It
is sometimes practiced on a 25-meter-long spring
track, competitors both male and female, perform two
passes, each containing eight skills, along the track.
taBle tennis
Table Tennis is also known as Ping-Pong, in which two or
four players participate using table-tennis rackets on a plain
hard surface called Table, which is divided by a net.
History
The game of Table Tennis probably descended from the
game of ‘Royal Tennis’, which was played in the medieval
era (12th century A.D.) Table Tennis was probably played
with improvised equipment in England during the last
quarter of 19th century. Evidence show that David Foster
in England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in
1890. One year later John Jaques came out with a game
called Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by
Jaques and the name was given as ‘Ping-Pong’. Table Tennis
is controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation)
which was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It
was introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea.
First World Championship of Table-Tennis was held in
London in 1926. TTFI (Table-Tennis Federation of India) was
formed in 1926 in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata.

Rules
• Table Tennis table is 9 ft. (2.74 meter) long, 5 ft.
(1.525 meter) wide and 2.5 ft.(76 centimeter) high.
• Net is 6 inches (15 centimeter) high from the table.
• A game of Table Tennis is played up to 11 points.
• A player or the pair who first scores 11 points wins
unless both players or pairs score 10 points then the
game is won by the player or pairs who gains 2 point
lead.
• If a player causes the table to move while the ball is in
play, player loses a point.
• A player shall score a point if the opponent’s free hand
touches the playing surface or the net assembly.
Fundamental techniques
62 1. Grip: Players grip their rackets in a variety of ways.
The manner in which players grip their rackets can
be classified into two major categories i.e. Pen hold
grip (mainly used by Chinese and Korean) and shake
hand or Orthodox grip (commonly used).
• Pen hold grip: In this, one grips the racket in such
a way as one holds a pen. It involves index finger
and think joining each other across the handle
and curling the middle, ring and fourth finger on
the back of the blade. The three fingers however,
will always remain touching one another.

II
Fig. 5.10: Pen hold grip
• Shake hand grip: In this grip, the racket is held
in such a way as one shakes hand with someone.
The shake hand grip is used due to increasingly
fast nature of the game, making the backhand
stroke more effective.
63
2. Services: There are different kind, of services, such as,
long service, short service, spin service, flat service,
high toss service and back-hand or forehand service.
3. Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive
and defensive including backhand and forehand.
(i) Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill,
hook, counter drive, flip and smash)
a) Drive: The racket is primarily perpendicular
to the direction of the stroke, and most of the
energy applied to the ball results in speed
rather than spin, creating a shot that does
not arc much, but it is fast enough to make it
difficult to return.
b) Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel
to the direction of the stroke (closed) and the
racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large
amount of topspin. Variations in spin and
speed add to the effectiveness of this shot.
c) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced
loopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme
topspin, but is typically slower.
d) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc,
with higher speed that resembles a speed
drive but with stronger topspin.
e) Hook: It is similar to a regular Loop, but carries
a tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side”
spin), it bounces sideways and downward
upon hitting the table.
f) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against
drives (normally high loop drives). One has

to bring close to the racket and stay close to
the ball (try to predict its path). The racket is
held closed and near to the ball, which is hit
with a short movement off the bounce (before
reaching the highest point) so that the ball
travels faster to the other side.
g) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that
has not bounced beyond the edge of the table,
however the ball may still be attacked, and the
resulting shot is called flip because the back
swing is compressed into a quick wrist action.
h) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her
opponent has returned a ball that bounces too
high and/ or too close to the net. Smashing
is a large back swing and rapid acceleration
imparting as much speed on the ball as possible.
(ii) Defensive strokes
a) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for
keeping the point alive and creating offensive
opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice,
the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting
backspin and causing the ball to float slowly
to the other side of the table. Offensive players
should only push for variation and not for
general rallies.
b) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin
counterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop
is essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well
back from the table. Sometimes a defensive
player can impart no spin on the ball during
a chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand
spin to the ball. This may further confuse his/
her opponent.
c) Block: A block is executed by simply putting
the racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds
back toward the opponent with nearly as
64
much energy as it came in with. This is not
as easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin,
speed, and location, all influence the correct
angle of a block.
d) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to
put a spin on the ball either to the right or the
left of the racket. The execution of this move
is similar to a slice, but to the right or left,
instead of down. This spin will result in the ball
curving to the side but bouncing in the opposite
direction when the opponent returns it.

e) Lob: The defensive High Ball or Lob is
deceptive in its simplicity. To execute a High
Ball, a defensive player first backs off the table
8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of
simply lifting the ball to an enormous height
before it falls back to the opponent’s side of
the table. A High Ball is inherently a creative
shot, and can have nearly any kind of spin.
f) Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke,
used as another variation for close-to-table
strokes. The player has position the racket close
to the ball and just let the ball touch it (without
any hand movement) in a way that the ball stays
close to the net with almost no speed and spin,
and touches the other side of the table more
than twice if the opponent doesn’t reach it.

Skills
Forehand drive
• Keep arm close to the torso.
• Forearm makes 90° with the upper arm.
• Draw the forearm back to another 45°.
• Let the waist turn naturally along with the arm and
shift your weight towards the right foot.
• Swing forward with a slight upward motion while
shifting your weight back to left foot.
• Elbow should be used as a pivot point and should only
move a little forward in the follow through.
Fig. 5.11: Forehand drive
Backhand drive
• Form ready position.
• Turn waist towards left with Racket towards 9 O’clock
position.

• Elbow acts as pivot point.
• Snap the forearm forward in slightly upward direction.
• Power comes with the flick of the wrist.
• Follow through until the racket points after the ball.
Fig. 5.12: Backhand drive
Blocking
It is a backup shot, when there isn’t enough time for a full
drive or loop. This stroke allows the players to use opponent
force against them.
• Adjust the racket angle according to the severity of top
spin. More the spin, more one should close the racket.
• Involve a little backspin and follow through.
• Execute immediately after the bounce to keep control
and speed.
• Hit the ball as it is rising off the surface of the table on
your side using 50 per cent of the stroke action before
hitting the ball and 50 per cent after hitting the ball.

History
An early version of Tennis started in the 16th century in
France where players would yell “tenez” when starting a
game giving the game the name, Tennis. Later the game was
refined in England in the 19th century as lawn tennis which
resembled the sport played today. The world’s oldest tennis
tournament, the Wimbledon Championships were first played
in London in 1877. The comprehensive rules promulgated
in 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation, now
known as the International Tennis Federation, have remained
largely stable, one of the major changes being the addition of
the tie-back system. The Davis Cup, an annual competition
between men’s national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous
competition for women’s national teams, the Fed Cup, was
founded as the Federation Cup in 1963. There are four top
tournaments called the Grand Slam Tournaments, these
are Wimbledon, the US Open, the Australian Open, and the
French Open.

Rules
The following are the rules regarding equipment, balls, court,
lines and scoring:
1. Equipment
(i) Racquets: Tennis racquet must adhere to the
following guidelines —
• The hitting area, composed of the strings,
must be flat and generally uniform.
• The frame of the hitting area may not be more
than 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in
width.
• The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape,
size, weight, and weight distribution. There
may not be any energy source built into the
racquet.
• The racquet must not provide any kind of
communication, instruction or advice to the
player during the match.
(ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a
felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant
colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in
the latter part of the 20th century to ensure better
visibility.
(iii) Court
• Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface,
usually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete
and/or asphalt and occasionally carpet
(indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long,
and 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches
and 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches.
• Additional clear space around the court is
required for players so as to reach over run
balls.
• A net is stretched across the full width of the
68 court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it
into two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches
(1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm)
high in the center.
(iv) Lines
• The lines that delineate the width of the court
are called the baseline (farthest back) and the
service line (middle of the court).
• The short mark in the center of each baseline
is referred to as either the hash mark or the
center mark.

• The outermost lines that make up the length
are called the doubles’ sidelines. These are
the boundaries used when doubles is being
played.
• The lines to the inside of the doubles’
sidelines are the singles’ sidelines and used as
boundaries in singles’ play. The area between
a doubles’ sideline and the nearest singles’
sideline is called the doubles’ alley, which is
considered playable in doubles’ play.
• The line that runs across the center of a
player’s side of the court is called the service
line because the serve must be delivered into
the area between the service line and the net
on the receiving side.
• All the lines are required to be 2 inches
69
(51 mm) in width. The baseline can be up to 4
inches (100 mm) wide if so desired.
(v) Scoring
• The players (or teams) start on opposite sides
of the net. One player is designated as the
server, and the opposing player is the receiver.
• A tennis match is determined through the
best of 3 or 5 sets. Women play 3 set matches,
while men play 5 set matches. For men, the
first player to win three sets wins the match,
and for women, the first player to win two sets
wins the match.
• A set consists of games, and a game, in turn,
consists of a sequence of points played with
the same player serving.
• A game is won by the first player to have won
at least four points in total and at least two
points more than the opponent.
• The running score of each game is described
in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from
zero to three points are described as “love”,
“15”, “30”, and “40” respectively
• If at least three points have been scored by
each player, making the player’s score equal
at 40 a piece, the score is not called out as
“40-40”, but rather as “deuce”.
• If at least three points have been scored by
each side and a player has one more point
than the opponent, the score of the game is
“advantage” for the player in the lead.

• A game point occurs in tennis whenever
the player who is in the lead in the game
needs only one more point to win the game.
The terminology is extended to sets (set
point), matches (match point), and even
championships (championship point).
• A break point occurs if the receiver, not the
sever, has a chance to win the game with
the next point. Break points are of particular
importance because serving is generally
considered advantageous, with the server being
expected to win games in which they are serving.
• A receiver who has one (score of 30–40), two
(score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40)
consecutive chances to win the game has
break point, double break point or triple break
point, respectively.
• If the leading player wins that game, the player
wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins
the game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break,
played under a separate set of rules, allows
one player to win one more game and thus the
set, to give a final set score of 7–6.
• In tournament play, the chair umpire
announces the winner of the set and the
overall score.
2. Grip
A grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit
shots during a match. There are three types of grip.
i. Forehand: the tennis forehand is a stroke in
which the inner side of the palm of the dominant
hand that is holding the racket faces forward. The
forehand stroke is made by swinging the racket
across one’s body in the direction of where one
wants to land the ball.
ii. Backhand: The backhand is a tennis stroke in
70
which one swings the racquet around one’s body
with the back of the hand preceding the palm.
iii. The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to
start a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet
so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service
box without being stopped by the net. There are
three types of serve —
a) Flat Serve
b) Slice Serve
c) Kick Serve

Swimming is a water based sport where a person propels the
body through the water by arms, known as strokes and legs
that are called kicks and move progressively through water.
It is a sport for all round development of the child. Swimming
improves cardiovascular system and places minimum stress
on joints. It employs major muscle groups of the body leading
to a well-developed flexible muscular system. Swimming is
also important for physical rehabilitation for people suffering
from disabilities or those recovering from injuries.

• There shall be four swimmers in each relay team. In
relay events, the team of swimmers whose feet lose
touch with the starting platform before the preceding
teammate touches the wall shall be disqualified. Any
relay team shall be disqualified from a race if a team
member, other than the swimmer designated to swim
that length, enters the water when the race is being
conducted, before swimmers of all teams have finished
the race. The member of a relay team and their order
of competing must be nominated before the race. Any
relay team member may compete in a race only once.
• The composition of a relay team may be changed
between the heats and finals of the event, provided that
it is made up from the list of swimmers properly entered
by a member for that event. Failure to swim in the
order listed will result in disqualification. Substitutions
may be made only in the case of a documented
medical emergency.
• Any swimmer having finished the race, or the stipulated
distance in a relay event, must leave the pool as soon
as possible without obstructing any other swimmer
who has not yet finished the race. Otherwise the
swimmer committing the fault or the relay team shall
be disqualified.
• Should a foul endanger the chances of success of a
swimmer, the referees shall have the power to allow the
swimmer to compete in the next heat or, should the
foul occur in a final event or in the last heat, they may
order it to be re-swim.
Fundamental techniques
Techniques in swimming are strokes, starts and turns.
Strokes
In swimming there are four competitive strokes (Front
Crawl, Back Crawl, Breast stroke and Butterfly stroke) being
followed all over the world. All the above mentioned strokes
72
have been learnt in the previous class.
Starts
All four competitive strokes are to be started in the competition
by using the technique known as start. The swimmers
emphasis on the quickest technique, which allows him a
stronger push off from the starting position. The starting
techniques, popular today, are: (i) Grab start (ii) Circular
start (iii) Racings start (iv) Conventional start (v) Tuck start.
The following sequence is followed; (i) Position on the block
(ii) Take off (iii) Flight (position in air) (iv) Entry into the water

(v) Glide (vi) First stroke. However, backstroke uses almost
a uniform technique, which does not have any special name
and is known as backstroke start.
Turns
During the race, the swimmer must take a turn from the end
of the wall to complete the full distance. The swimmers try
to use a technique that is quicker and gives a strong push
off from the wall within the permissible rules of the stroke.
The various turns used by swimmers are: (i) Simple turn
(ii) Throw away turn (iii) Summer Sault turn (iv) Flip turn (v)
Roll over turn (vi) Breast stroke turn (vii) Butterfly turn.
The following sequence is followed in the turn: (i) Approach
to the wall (ii) Turn or touch (iii) Push off (iv) Glide (v) First
stroke.
Tactics
73
Swimming is an individual and cyclic sport. It is highly
competitive with the application of science. It is getting
transformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is
given to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the
race. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer
must learn to distribute the distance economically and
thoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming
during different races can be categorised in three different
phase — (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long
distance races
Sprint races
The 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start,
maintaining the speed and a good finish.
Middle and Long distance races
In these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed.
In middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to
prevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very
fast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early
in the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed.
Swimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal
pace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy
waters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in
relation to the opponent.
