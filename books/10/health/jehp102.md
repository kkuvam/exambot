In this chapter, we shall discuss the effects, both short-
term and long-term, of physical activity on each of the major
organ systems of human body. You are aware that a healthy
individual is one who has a healthy mind in a healthy body.
This state of health can be achieved when various organ
systems of the body function in harmony. For example,
physical activities are based on motor movements and their
co-ordination. The command for movements comes from the
brain which is a part of the nervous system. The required
energy for movements and other activities is obtained from
food. Food is completely digested in the intestine, a part of
digestive system. Food and oxygen reach all the parts of body
through the action of heart, which is a part of the circulatory
system. In fact, many organ systems of the body function as
an integrated whole for healthy maintenance of the body.
You have already studied about organ systems of the
human body in the previous science classes. In this chapter,
the organ systems have been discussed in relation to the
effect of physical activities. It is a common experience that
performance in any event, sports or otherwise, depends
upon physical health, as well as, mental and emotional
health. Development and maintenance of physical, mental
and emotional health specially during this coronavirus
(COVID-19) is therefore, very important.
Organ SyStemS Of Human BOdy
Aggregates of cells constitute a tissue. Tissues of various kinds
together make an organ and many organs together comprise
an organ system. Various organ systems perform different
functions of the body necessary for wellbeing and healthy living.
The organs which have a major role to play in the functioning of
their respective system, such as, heart, lungs, liver and kidney

are called vital organs. Before we learn about the impact of
physical activities on organ systems, let us review functioning
of these systems.
Organ systems for movement of body and limbs:
skeletal and muscular systems
When you walk, play, exercise, practice or participate in a
sport, or even when you ‘warm up’ prior to a sport activity
or competition, what is most obvious are the movements
of hands and legs, with the brain being equally active.
All the movements are due to contraction of muscles. Muscles
are attached to bones. Bones form the skeleton. Bones are
attached to each other by ligaments and muscles are attached
to bones by tendons (Fig. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

Body
Muscles are made up of muscle cells which are also
termed as muscle fibres because of their elongated shape.
You have learnt in earlier classes that there are mainly three
kinds of muscles. There are muscles that contract to cause
movements according to one’s will. These are called voluntary
muscles, such as, those of the limbs and the neck. The
involuntary muscles, such as, those lining the food canal,
move automatically without our efforts for making them move.
Another kind of muscles, which are also involuntary, are the
muscles of the heart or cardiac muscles which never stop
contracting and relaxing. As learnt in earlier classes, muscle
cells (muscle fibres) may be striated (voluntary) muscle fibres,

in the muscle fibres. Upon receiving instructions from the brain
and nerves, these proteins slide over each other and the muscle
contracts. Muscle contraction uses up energy, which comes
from food. It is measured in calories.
Energy producing organ systems

Through digestive system, food gets digested and
converted to a form, which can be broken down
in the cell to release energy. Respiratory system

You have already learnt in earlier classes that when
muscles of rib cage and diaphragm (the muscular partition
between thorax and abdomen) contract and flatten, the
thoracic cavity increases in volume and air from outside
rushes in. It passes through nostrils, pharynx, trachea and
bronchi and reaches the lungs (inhalation). The reverse
happens during exhalation when muscles of the rib cage
and diaphragm relax and CO laden air from lungs goes out
14 2
through bronchi, trachea and nostrils.
Breathing is followed by internal respiration when oxygen
laden air from alveoli or air sacks of lungs is picked up by
capillaries and reaches the heart through pulmonary vein.
Once oxygen reaches cells, it oxidises glucose (which reaches
cells after digestion through blood) to release energy as ATP
or adenosine tri phosphate.
Circulatory system circulates nutrients and oxygen to all
parts of the body. It also carries carbon dioxide and other
waste substances produced in the body to organs (lungs and

kidneys) for their removal. It also transports hormones and
minerals required for the body.
The flow chart below shows organs of circulatory system
for you to recall.
Organs of the circulatory system
Heart Blood Vessels
Arteries Veins Capillaries
Heart (Fig. 2.8) is the most vital organ of the body. It is
situated between the two lungs in the thoracic cavity and
is a cone shaped muscular, four chambered organ covered
by a membrane. The four chambers are left and right atria
(singular atrium) and left and right ventricles. They are
separated by muscular partitions called septa singular
15
septum. The chambers communicate by openings which are
protected by valves.
The cardiac muscle cells continuously contract and relax
(heart beat) for pumping blood into the organs and receiving
blood from them. As the heart beats, oxygenated blood flows
into the arteries and goes to various parts of the body, and
then it flows back to the heart through veins for oxygenation
in the lungs. This circulation of blood is depicted below.
Blood flow between heart and lungs is called pulmonary
circulation, while between heart and body parts is called
systemic circulation.
The process of circulation is shown in Fig 2.10 and further
elaborated below.

• From right atrium, deoxygenated blood goes to right
ventricle and then through pulmonary artery to lungs.
• Pulmonary vein carries (oxygenated blood) from the
lungs to the left atrium of the heart from where it goes
to the left ventricle.
• Aorta, a large artery arises from left ventricle and the
oxygenated blood enters the arteries and reaches all
the organs through them.

In the diagram below, fill in the blanks with the words provided
within brackets. In the upper boxes name the parts of the body
from where blood is entering or going to and in the lower box

Now you have understood that blood flows from various
parts of the body to heart, heart to lungs, lungs to heart
and heart to various parts of the body. Since, in one circuit
of circulation, blood passes through the heart twice, blood
circulation is termed double circulation. Regular physical
exercise has a positive effect on circulation. Hence, regular
physical exercise is important for all.

Body
Muscles
Physical activity build and strengthen muscles, which can
protect the bones from injury, support and protect joints from
being affected by arthritis. Strong muscles also give stability
and improve balance and coordination during movements.
Physical activities also improve blood supply to the muscles
and increase their capacity to use oxygen.
Muscles and muscle performance
Physical activities if undertaken regularly have beneficial
effects on the muscular system. Whenever physical activities,
games or sport are undertaken there is contraction of muscles
and increase in energy level due to breakdown of ATP.
The beneficial effects of regular physical activities are
listed below —
• Change in shape and size of the muscle fibres: Muscle
fibres enlarge with physical activities which cause an
17
overall enlargement of muscles with the change in
its size and shape. The size of muscles increases by
60 per cent. It is because of this reason that, the
muscles of arms of a tennis player are well developed.
• Maintenance of muscle tone: Muscles are stimulated
to contract by signals from nerves. Due to continuous
signals, when physical exercises are undertaken,
muscles remain in partial state of contraction called
muscle tone. Hence, regular physical activities maintain
good muscle tone and enhance physical fitness.
• Increase in muscle proteins: The units of muscle
contraction are proteins. Physical activities lead to
increase in total proteins.
• Increase in blood capillaries: Regular physical exercises
lead to increase in number of blood capillaries supplying
blood to muscles.
• Increase in efficiency of ligaments and tendons:
Ligaments and tendons become more efficient as a
result of regular physical activity. This improves muscle
movements resulting in greater tolerance of stress
during strenuous activity.
• Long term increase in muscle strength: Regular physical
exercises increase and maintain strength of muscles.
This increases speed of contraction as in the case of
marathon runner and also work well against load as in
the case of weight lifter.
• Delay in muscle fatigue: Muscles need oxygen to
contract. But when muscles are used for a long time
during sport, available oxygen gets used up and
lactic acid accumulates. This causes muscle fatigue.
It is, therefore, important to do physical activities like
stretching to delay muscle fatigue.

• Maintaining correct posture and beautiful body: Regular
physical activities and yogic activity like asanas prevent
postural deformities. Healthy muscles give the body a
beautiful shape.
Oxygen Debt
During physical activities, respiratory rate increases. At the
same time, oxygen gets speedily used up, this creates an oxygen
debt, as the rate of oxygen intake may not match the oxygen
requirement due to the exercise. Thus, maximum exercises are
followed by a recovery period when oxygen debt is removed by
obtaining more oxygen. For example, when an athlete is running
and requires 3 litres of oxygen, if oxygen obtained is only 2 litres,
oxygen debt of 1 litre is created, which gets recovered during
recovery period.
• Overall improvement in efficiency of muscle movements
and reaction time: Muscles contract on receiving
stimulus from nerves. The time taken to react to the
stimuli (reaction time) improves with regular physical
exercise.
• Increase in capacity for storage of food: Regular physical
activities help cells to store more food, which can be
readily available for oxidation to provide energy when
needed.
Respiratory system
• Increase in size of lungs and volume of chest: Physical
activities require more oxygen. Therefore, more oxygen
has to be inhaled. This provides exercise to the lungs and
chest and as a result the size increases. Simultaneously,
the diaphragm and rib muscles strengthen.
• Increase in lung power: Respiratory exercises, which
include Pranayam and Anulom-vilom, improve lung
power. The efficiency of alveoli or air sacs of lungs also
improves.
• Activation of unused (inactive) alveoli: Active inhalation
increases residual volume of air, tidal air and vital
capacity which is important for healthy body.
18
Residual volume of air: Even after forced expiration some air
remains in the lung, it cannot be expelled and is called residual
air.
Vital capacity: Vital capacity is the amount of air inhaled and
exhaled with maximum effort. In normal adult, it is 3500 cc to
4500 cc.
Vital Capacity = TV + IRV + ERV
(TV= Tidal Volume, IRV =Inspiratory Reserve Volume, ERV=Expiratory
Reserve Volume)
TV: The volume of air breathed in and out during quiet breathing
is called tidal volume.

IRV: Air over and above tidal volume that can be breathed in
upon continuous inhalation.
ERV: Air breathed out over and above TV upon continuous
exhalation.
Exercising regularly makes vital capacity go upto 5500cc.
Circulatory system
Blood pumped into circulation transports oxygen and food
to tissues, removes waste and also transports hormones
to target organs. During physical activities, nutrients and
Oxygen is needed by muscles to get energy for contraction.
So heart pumps at a faster rate and circulation is speeded up.
But this change is temporary. Certain permanent changes
also occur when physical activities are undertaken regularly.
These are given below.
• Increase in the size of heart occurs as cardiac muscles
develop with regular physical activities. Regular
19
exercise increases the capacity and thickness of the
walls of the heart.
• Increase in number of capillaries and blood cells:
The unused capillaries become active with physical
activities making circulation efficient. An increase in
the number of blood cells and amount of hemoglobin
has also been observed.
• Decrease in heart rate: Under normal conditions the
heart beats 72 times per minute at rest. But an athlete’s
heart rate may be found to be much lower at rest. The
athlete’s heart becomes so efficient that at rest same
requirement is fulfilled with fewer heartbeats.
• Increase in stroke volume: Stroke volume is the quantity
of blood pumped out by aorta in one stroke. Heart,
having gained efficiency with regular physical activities,
is able to pump out more blood in one stroke.

• Decrease in LDL and increase in HDL: LDL and HDL are
low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins
respectively. Lipoproteins are secreted by liver. LDL,
also known as bad cholesterol, adversely affects the
blood vessels of the heart. On the other hand, HDL
which is good cholesterol helps to remove cholesterol
from the body. Regular physical activities help in
production of more HDL and less LDL Thus physical
activities help in reducing blood cholesterol.
