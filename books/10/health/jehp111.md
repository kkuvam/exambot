The quality of life in any community is a strong indicator of
the health of its members. Our socio-economic needs are
such that people depend upon each other as we cannot live
in isolation. We live together and collectively share certain
amenities that are necessary for our day-to-day existence.
In the previous classes (Class VII to IX), we read about the
negative effects of unhygienic or filthy surroundings on our
health. Regular access to basic amenities, such as, clean water,
sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health care services,
recreational facilities, etc., are important for prevention
of illnesses and diseases. For prevention of diseases like
coronavirus, maintaining of social distance is very important.
In this chapter, the essential features of healthy community
living including social distancing during coronavirus will be
discussed. The focus will also be on the principles of cooperative
living to ensure healthy living conditions for one and all.
HealtHy Community living
Our way of life, and the utilisation of resources, decide the
quality of our personal and community life. A healthy way of
living in the community is ensured not only by the optimal
use of resources but also by keeping our environment clean
and hygienic. Let us understand what is meant by healthy
community living.

India Magazine. It is about 75 km away from Shillong,
the capital of Meghalaya. Most of the houses in this village
are beautifully decorated with flowers and plants. As per
the Census of 2011, the total population of Mawlynnong
is 414. The main occupation of the villagers is agriculture,
but it has also been an age old tradition of ensuring that
the surrounding environment is clean. In fact cleanliness is
a collective effort and this practice is ingrained in the people
since their childhood. The people voluntarily sweep the roads
and lanes, water the plants in public areas and clean the
drains. A dustbin made out of bamboo is found all along
the village. Everyone makes it a point that dirt and waste
are not thrown anywhere. All the waste from the dustbin is
collected and kept in a pit, which the villagers use as manure.
Trees are planted to restore and maintain nature’s balance.
Mawlynnong’s fame as the cleanest village in Asia, is drawing
a lot of domestic as well as international tourists, as a result of
which tourism is also an important source of employment for
the local youths. Besides, there are many interesting sights
to see such as the famous living root bridge in the nearby
village of Riwai, which is a fascinating example of indigenous
methods of conservation and sustainability. Local youths are
available as enthusiastic and informative guides.

These activities will enable you to understand various features of
healthy community living. Through these activities, you may have
observed that in a community, a group of people live in a particular
local area. Secondly, they share common facilities, which differ from
place to place. In some areas, people have access to facilities, such
as, water supply, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health
care services, recreational facilities, community centre, schools,
transportation, etc., but in some places people do not have access to
even the most basic amenities.
A community is said to be healthy when its members
continuously work together to maintain, improve and expand
the available natural resources and avoid their wastage.
The healthy community only be develped when its members
recognise their roles and responsibilities. They strive to
inculcate values and attitudes of cooperation, mutual
respect, tolerance, kindness, etc. The role of Panchayati Raj,
civil societies and other government institutions is also very
important to promote healthy living.
Important features of healthy community living
Maintaining cleanliness of our home and surroundings is
an essential feature of healthy community living. Healthy
community is one in which all residents have access to
quality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate
employment, transportation, physical activity and
nutrition. Living in overcrowded and unhygienic places
with excessive noise and pollution, may lead to various
forms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack
of adequate space, poor ventilation in rooms and toxic
fumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases.
Access to basic amenities such as regular water supply,
safe drinking water and sanitation, is important for
healthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes
VII to IX), it has been learnt that open and unattended
garbage dumps are a potential breeding place for flies,
cockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open
drains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as,
196
malaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases,
such as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis
are also resulted due to water pollution.
Access to basic amenities also includes other provisions
such as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities,
roads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment,
security, recreational facilities and so on. Imagine a situation
when a member in the family falls seriously ill and requires
urgent treatment. What would happen to this person if there
are no hospitals in the nearby city, or no transportation
facilities to reach there?

To ensure these basic amenities, the role of the local
government or panchayats is very important. They are required
to ensure rules and regulations for safety measures, cleanliness,
ensure equal access of public amenities to all members,
promote adoption of waste management practices, and help
ecological restoration and conservation. However, we cannot
depend solely on the government to take the initiative. The
quality of life in a community also depends on how the members
of the community work to improve on available resources
and ensure that the government provides for these facilities.

popularly as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,
the vision of a Clean and hygienic India, once
seen by Mahatma Gandhi, can happen only if
members of every community cooperate and
accept individual and collective responsibility
of keeping themselves, their homes and their
surroundings clean.
In order to work collectively, members of a community
need to develop values of co-operation, kindness, respect,
gratitude, joy, peace and selflessness. These attributes are
important in fostering the principles of collective work and
in nurturing healthy social relationships. The example
of Mawlynnong village shows that high income alone
is not the only criterion for healthy living. Cooperative
action, responsibility and positive values can also help in
improving the quality of life, and healthy living conditions
for one and all.

• Do not hold events where people have to gather
(even if it is a corner meeting with three or four friends,
or an evening chat on the chaupal).
• Do not go to crowded places like markets, shopping,

Dealing with the stigma
What is stigma?
In any epidemic, it is common for individuals to feel stressed
and worried because they fear —
• falling ill and dying.
• approaching health facilities due to fear of becoming
infected while in care.
• losing livelihoods, not being able to work during
isolation, and of being dismissed from work.
• being socially excluded or placed in quarantine because
of being associated with the disease.
• feeling powerless in protecting loved ones and fear of
losing loved ones because of the virus or being separated
198
during quarantine.
• feelings of helplessness, boredom, loneliness and
depression due to being isolated and not working
towards caring for a dependent.
Stress is caused due to the above fears and being treated as
an outcaste or blamed for spreading the disease.
What is the reason behind the stigma?
The level of stigma associated with COVID-19 is based on
three main factors —

• COVID-19 is a new disease about which many things
are still being discovered.
• When something is unknown people are worried which
leads to fear.
• Rumours or fake news give wrong information and
spreads the fear.
Recognising the stigma
It is very important to recognise stigma and handle it. Below
are four case studies related to these issues. Read these case
studies and recognise the stigma.
CASE 1
You are in the grocery shop, there are several people who are
wearing a mask. You see Babulal, the store owner, going red
in his face as he tries to suppress a cough.
CASE 2 199
Sukhram has come back from Pune where he works as a
taxi driver. They stay in a joint family and you have taken
his contact history as advised by your supervisor. You come
to know that Sukhram’s family members have asked him to
leave the house.
CASE 3
Beauty works in Delhi as a house maid. recently she has come
back and you have been told that beauty’s employers have
asked her to leave as she had a cold.
CASE 4
Surali is a young girl of 11 years. She and her 8-year-old
brother are staying with an aunt as their parents have
been asked to go in for isolation. Surali’s aunt keeps on
complaining to you that the children are a big burden on the
family’s resources.
What will you feel like if you were Babulal, Rani, Sukhram
and Beauty?
• Babulal has simple cough. But he is too scared to
cough in front of people as he will loose the customers.
• Sukhram needs family support to help him stay in
isolation. If everyone takes proper precautions the
infection need not spread.
• Beauty has a seasonal cold but she has been asked to
leave by her employers.
• Surali and her brother are two small children who need
to be supported and this kind of incident can cause
mental stress even in the future. Child Protection Cell
(CPC) should be approached for appropriate measures
for helping children in difficult situations.

How to develop values and attitudes conducive for healthy and
cooperative living? These values have to emanate from within
a person, but they can also be developed through various
other ways. Camping can be seen as one of these ways which
is extremely appropriate for students, particularly during the
adolescent period.
What is camping?
Youngsters might

activities from friends.
Camping is an outdoor
activity, where familiar
surroundings are left to
spend a night or several
nights at an outdoor
site. The location of
these sites varies as
per the objectives of the
Fig. 11.6: Camping
trip, time of the year
and budget available.
Common camping sites are: visits to villages or rural areas
to understand their pattern of living; mountain areas,
national parks, lakes, beaches, forests, etc. One can also
plan camping activities in a nearby place, such as, open
fields, park, or even in an open space of the school premises.
The basic camping equipment include tents, cooking utensils
or gadgets, sleeping bags, first aid kits, ropes, insect repellents,

etc. These requirements will vary as per the location of the
camping site and objectives of the trip. However, irrespective
of the location, the essence of all camping activities revolves
around two main features —
(i) Bonding with nature
(ii) Importance of living in a community.
Importance of camping
Camping gives students a good break, away from the
monotony of the classroom. It gives an opportunity to
learn from nature in a joyful, exciting and adventurous
manner. Living in the natural environment with students
from different areas, cultures, religions and backgrounds,
help then to learn to work as a team in various activities.
These activities differ from adventurous and challenging
ones, to the most basic ones, such as, cooking, cleaning,
collecting water, etc. In this process, students learn the 201
importance of self-reliance, teamwork, co-existence,
importance of natural resources and organisational skills.
Camping also offers great opportunities for empowerment
of the girls.
Fig. 11.7: Trekking Fig. 11.8: Mountaineering Fig. 11.9: Rock climbing
While camping, one can engage in adventure sport,
such as, trekking, river rafting, mountaineering, rock
climbing, repelling, paragliding, caving. Adventure sport
help to develop courage, self-confidence, leadership
qualities and enhance concentration powers. This is also
a great form of physical exercise. However, these activities
should be conducted only in the presence of qualified and
professional trainers. Joining the National Cadet Corps
(NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) or Bharat Scouts
and Guides will also give you opportunities to take part in
these activities.

A guided walk through the forest helps to explore
nature. It can also complement much of the textual data
in your geography and science textbooks through direct
experiences. At the same time, learn to appreciate the beauty
and simplicity of nature to make all understand how much
disconnected from ‘Mother Earth one has become.’ You realise
the importance of nature and how we should take care of it.
Moreover, through interaction with local communities, one
learns about edible and medicinal plants, local crafts, first-
aid and various other sustainable forms of living.
During the evenings all may gather around campfires which
give a great opportunity for social bonding. Campfires also
enable to learn about different cultures through story telling,
songs, dances, skits and games. On many occasions hidden
talents of individuals are brought out during these activities.
