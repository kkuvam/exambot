You have learnt in previous classes that growth is a natural
phenomenon. ‘Growth’ is a characteristic of all living beings.
The period of growth and development from childhood to
adulthood is a period full of joy and challenges is known as
‘adolescence’. This chapter deals with key aspects and issues
related to the period of adolescence.

understAndinG Adolescence
The period of adolescence begins with the onset of puberty,
during which certain hormones gets activated. It is an
increase in secretion of sex hormones (testosterone in males,
estrogen and progesterone in females). Puberty merges into
adolescence at around 10 years of age, and adolescence
generally lasts till 19 years of age. You may recall the
discussion on adolescence in the chapters of your Class VIII
textbook of science and the Class IX textbook of Health and
Physical Education.
During this phase, significant physical and psychological
changes take place. However, as you have already learnt in
your previous classes, the timing of these changes varies
with every individual.
Unique features of adolescence
The two unique features of adolescence are —
(i) The spurt in physical growth, when a physical
appearance of an individual gradually becomes
different. This is due to the rapid acceleration in
growth of skeletal tissue (bones and cartilage) and
muscular and glandular tissue. For examples, breasts
begin to develop in girls due to the release of estrogen
24 hormone. Changes in voice are quite noticeable
among boys.
(ii) It is a time period between the onset of puberty and
adulthood.
Growth spurt in adolescents
As you would have experienced yourself, the changes during
adolescence occur speedily and alter the body size and shape
of adolescents. Suddenly the child seems to have grown up
into a young adult. This is called growth spurt and is shown
through the following flow chart.

Under the influence of growth hormone, the body size
increases. Sex hormones stimulate growth and maturity of
gonads (reproductive organs). In males, testes grow in size and
start producing sperms. In females, the eggs or ova present
in the ovary since birth begins to mature. Sex organs also
increase in size. Thus, there is an overall growth in body size.
As sexual maturity progresses during adolescence, hormones
act on growth centers of bones which are responsible for
increase in length of bones. The long bones, the vertebrae
and limbs grow and the adolescent gains height. The limbs
become stronger. The heart, lungs and other internal organs
also grow to match the increase in body size. The muscle
mass undergoes a spurt at adolescence. Eventually, growth
rate slows down and then stops. Generally, at the age of 14
to 18 years of age, adult height is already reached. The peak
of growth of muscle mass is also typically around the age of
14 to 16 years. In the females, the pelvis region undergoes a
growth spurt and becomes wider.
secondAry sexuAl chArActeristics
In earlier classes, you have learnt about secondary sexual
characteristics. As a result of physical changes, secondary
sexual characteristics begin to develop in both girls and
boys. Some characteristics are related to girls; some to boys
and some are common for both. You may understand this
development better by conducting Activity 3.1.
Activity 3.1
Identify the secondary sexual characteristics of adolescence during
10 to 19 years in the given table. Fill the following table by putting
a tick mark () at appropriate place in each column.

wet dreAms
Wet dreams are a normal and natural physiological process
which starts during adolescence among boys. It usually
occurs during sleep. Wet dreams is a discharge of semen
(seminal fluid) containing sperms. Many adolescent boys are
usually not aware of this phenomenon and get worried when
they face this situation first time.
Semen is the fluid formed by glands associated with male
reproductive system. Semen carries mature sperms formed
in the testes.
Read the following case studies which confirm the
uniqueness of every individual with regard to time of
occurrence of changes during adolescence.
CASE 1: My father calls me ‘Sher’
Rakesh and Dibang, students of Class IX, are walking home
together from school. Rakesh begins to tease Dibang, saying
that he speaks in a girl’s voice. He also laughs at the fact
that Dibang has got no hair on his upper lip. “Look at me,”
26 Rakesh says, “I am a real man. My voice is strong and my
face is manly - I have so much facial hair. My father calls me
sher.” Dibang wonders what is wrong with him. He recalls
that his mother still calls him ‘my sweet boy’. He decides
to go home and ask his mother why he is so different from
Rakesh and whether something is wrong with him.
Points for Discussion
a) What do you think Dibang felt with Rakesh’s remarks?
b) Do you think that there is something wrong with
Dibang? Why?

• You should not compare your physical changes with
others – the pace at which changes take place differ
from person to person.
• It is natural to feel awkward or conscious of the changes
that occur but try to support each other by accepting
these as part of a natural process and don’t let these
decrease your self-confidence.
• If you have any doubts or concerns about changes that
are occurring to you reach out to a trusted adult or
you can talk to a counsellor in the adolescent friendly
Health Clinic near where you live.
• Many young boys due to feeling of shame visit quacks
and waste lot of time and money. It is best to visit the
doctor or the health centre. One can discuss the myths
related to growing up with a trusted person (teacher,
parents, friends).
• There is a myth that wet dream causes weakness among
the males because semen is lost from the body. However
it is not so, semen and sperms are continuously made
in the testes and semen lost during wet dream gets
replaced very soon.
menstruAtion
The first menstruation is termed as menarche. In India, age
of menarche is 12-13 years but may vary from individual to
individual. Menstruation generally stops between the age of
45 and 55 years and is termed as menopause. Menopausal age
varies in different individuals. Age of menarche has decreased
due to various lifestyle changes. Menstruation hygiene and
cleanliness is very important. Points to remember —
• Regular bath and washing self properly are important
for avoiding infections, especially during menstruation.
• Change undergarment regularly (at least once a day)
and avoid synthetic cloth.
• During menstruation, cloth, cloth pads or napkins should
be changed after every four to six hours to avoid infection.
28
• One can also use sanitary napkins to manage
menstrual hygiene. Many girls and women also make
sanitary napkins at home with old cloth and cotton. If
one makes a sanitary napkin at home, use only clean,
soft cotton cloth. Do not use old cloth that may have
any metal or plastic parts in it like glitter, gota or hooks
and buttons. This may hurt or cause infection.
• If a cloth is used again as pad, it should be washed
thoroughly with soap and dried in sun before next use
as sunlight is an excellent disinfectant. Do not use dirty
or damp cloth as it causes infections.

• Child With Special Need (CWSN) should be shown the
process of maintaining hygiene or explained in detail
if necessary.
• Sanitary pads should be wrapped in paper and disposed
in trash bins or buried deep in a pit. Some schools have
Incinerators which offer another safe way to dispose
sanitary pads. There should be no shame attached in
the process of disposing sanitary pads.
Government is supporting schemes for promoting menstrual
hygiene among adolescent girls (10-19 years). Sanitary
napkins are made available in schools or by ASHAs at a
subsidised rate.

Adolescent or teenAGe preGnAncy
An adolescent is capable of reproduction. However, the
reproductive maturity is reached only when a teenager is fully
developed physically and physiologically. In India, because
of early marriage, there are large number of adolescents or
teenage pregnancies. If pregnancy occurs before reaching
complete reproductive maturity, girls may risk their own
health and that of the fetus (developing embryo).
Risks involved in adolescent pregnancy are mentioned
below —
• An adolescent mother is not mentally prepared for
motherhood.
• An adolescent mother is likely to be anemic.
• An adolescent mother is more prone towards maternal
death while giving birth.
• Infant death are more among teenage mothers.
• There is likelihood of developing complications during
giving birth.
• The baby born from teenage mother requires greater
care which the teenage mother may not be able to give.
• The reproductive tract may be damaged during
childbirth.
• Early pregnancy and motherhood delays development
of education and career of adolescent mother.
• There may be economic problems and also problems
due to psychological immaturity of the adolescent
mother. This may hamper proper care of the infant.

external parts, the internal organs also have to function
normally. You know that certain vital functions of the body
for enjoying good health are maintenance of blood pressure,
pulse rate, respiratory rate, etc. Some ways of assessing
