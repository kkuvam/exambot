In the previous chapter, we have discussed team games
like Football, Hockey, Basketball, Cricket and Volleyball.
This chapter includes Kabaddi, Kho-Kho and Combative
sports like Judo and Wrestling.
Kabaddi
Kabaddi is an indigenous game which is popular in India.
It is a simple and inexpensive game and does not require a
big playing area or any equipment. This game is popular in
the villages and small towns in India. It is played throughout
Asia with minor modifications. Kabaddi is quite new to the
other parts of the world. It was known by various names in
different parts of India. For example, Chedugudu or Gudu-
gudu in Southern parts of India, Ha-du-du (Men), Chu-kit-
kit (Women) in Eastern India, Hu-tu-tu in Maharashtra in
western India and Kabaddi in Northern India. It is a game of
attack and defense. The two teams occupy opposite halves
of a field and take turn in sending a ‘Raider’ into the other
half. In order to win points, members of the opposite team
are tagged and the raider tries to return to half, holding the
breath and chanting, “Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi”.

History
According to some historians Kabaddi might have developed
during prehistoric times when human beings were forced
to defend themselves from sudden attacks from ferocious
beasts. There is also another school of thought, in India,
which believes that this game is a version of Chakravyuha,
Do You Know? used in Mahabharata. The game was demonstrated for the

Court
The Kabaddi court measures 13×10 meters for men and 12×8
meters for women with a line dividing it into identical halves
denoting actual playing area of the two teams. Traditionally
the game is played outdoors and the entire court is dug at
least 1 foot deep. The mud is removed and filled with sand
from the river or beach. This ensures that the player is not
seriously injured if he falls or is dragged by opponents.
However, now synthetic Kabaddi fields are used for comfort
and to reduce injuries. Tournaments like the Indian Kabaddi
league have emerged as crowd pullers in urban areas.
Team
Each team shall consist of minimum 10 and maximum 12
players. Seven players shall take the ground at a time and
the remaining players are the substitutes.
Duration of the match
The duration of the match is divided into two halves of 20
minutes each. In case of men and junior boys there is a
5 minutes interval and in case of women, junior girls, sub-
junior boys and girls two halves of 15 minutes with 5 minutes
interval. The teams shall change court after interval. The
number of players for each team at the start of the second
half shall remain the same as it was at the end of first half.
The last raid of each half of the match shall be allowed to be
completed even after completion of the scheduled time as
mentioned above.

scored in addition to the bonus point for crossing the

Fundamental skills
Skills
The skills used by the raider in kabaddi are called offensive
skills. The skills used by the antis are called defensive skills.
During a raid, the raider has to make maximum use of his
limbs to come in contact or touch the opponents in order to
score points. This is accomplished through leg touches, such
as, toe touch, foot touch, squat leg, thrust, kicks, etc., with
lower limbs and through hand touches with upper limbs.
Offensive skills
a) Touch: Touch is a fundamental and the easiest
skill, which every raider applies in one or the
other forms. There are different kinds of touches
such as —
(i) Hand touch: (a) running hand touch
(b) stooping hand touch (c) turning hand-touch
(d) hopping hand touch (e) fake and touch
(ii) Toe touch: This offensive skill is used by
almost every raider. A raider can execute this

skill even from a considerable distance from
the anties. During the course of a raid, the
raider will move in different angles, according
to the positions and moves of the opponents.
At the same time, in order to apply this skill,
the raider requires to extend his leg towards
the opponent suddenly.
(iii) Foot touch: The modern toe touch is a
moderate form of foot-touch. The major
difference between these two skills is that
in foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the
opponents with complete foot whereas in toe
touch, toe is used to touch the opponents.
This skill helps the raider to cover more
area in the opponent’s court and has an
advantage over toe touch.
b) Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations.
Mule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the
raider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various
types of kicks, such as —
i. Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind
the raider during the course of raid is known
as back kick. The different forms of back kick
are: (i) running back kick (ii) standing back
kick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and
back kick.
ii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to
second and attack the central zone will find
this skill the most suitable. The method and
principle of kick are the same as in the case
of back kick. The only difference between
the two is that the area to be covered is
sideward.
iii. Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the
leg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve
from back to the side. This type of kick will
116 enable the raider to cover more area with the
attacking leg. At the same time it enables the
raider to change his direction.
Defensive skills
a) Ankle hold: This is a counter skill used by
defensive players against leg thrusts and foot
touches during an attack or raid. A team, which
has mastery over ankle hold, can plan different
strategies and tactics in various situations, such
as, (a) lifting up (b) pulling back (c) changing
direction of the raider.

b) Thigh hold: This skill is a good defensive skill.
Every team uses this technique as a planned
and surprise tactic. For example: (a) Taking one
step forward and hold — Taking one step forward
means holding the raider’s thigh on wrong step or
rear leg (b) thigh hold from behind.
c) Waist hold or trunk hold: Waist hold is a skill used
by a defender to catch the raider from behind.
d) Wrist hold: Wrist hold is also a defensive skill and
used occasionally only when a situation presents
itself. This hold is rarely used now a days.
e) Blocking: It is a defensive skill used by covers
and corners. Blocking is an act of creating a
wall of obstruction in the path of the raider to
prevent the movement. The aim of blocking is not
just to obstruct the path, but also to catch
117
the raider.
Tactics
Tactics means exploiting a given situation to one’s advantage.
This is also done to create a situation to suit one’s purpose.
The raider may increase or decrease the tempo of the game
depending on the situation. In order to do this the player
may adopt a passive raid or an aggressive raid by creating a
situation for a struggle. Sometimes the raider may pass time
in the last few minutes of the game, especially when the team
is leading and the opponents are playing an aggressive game.
Keeping in view the game situation, different tactics adopted
by the raider.
Retreat
Unless the raider returns to home court safely after the raid,
the raid cannot be treated as successful. This is called a
retreat. The raider has to pre-plan the path of retreat before
starting the raid. While retreating to home court, the raider
should keep the following points in view —
• The raider does not give room for pursuit.
• The raider regains their defensive position quickly
before the opponent team’s raider begins the raid.
• While returning to home court, the raider must pass
only through the midline.
Raid
Raid is the offence part of the game. The main feature of
the game is raiding on the opponent’s court, alternatively by
both the team players. The defence is done with teamwork
while only one player makes an attack.

Cant
‘Cant’ is holding of breath by the raider during the attack
and chanting the word kabaddi, kabaddi, respectively, in one
single expiration.
Kho-Kho
Kho-Kho is one of the most popular traditional team sport in
India. It is the simplest form of chasing and touching a person.
It is an inexpensive and enjoyable sport that demands physical
fitness and a set of skills. Dodging, feigning and bursts of
controlled speed make this game quite thrilling. To catch by
pursuit is to chase, rather than just run — is the main skill
of Kho-Kho. This game is played in two innings by two teams
on a rectangular court. One team becomes the chasers and
the other the runners. In the game, the chaser pursues the
runners and touches them and puts them out. Each team
has to chase and defend for 9 minutes twice in a match.
Fig. 7.3: Player playing kho-kho
History
In the ancient era, a version of the Kho-Kho game was played
on ‘raths’ or chariots in Maharashtra, and this was known
as Rathera. The Kho-Kho rules were first framed in the early
118
1900’s. A committee was formed at Puna Gymkhana in 1914
for framing the Kho-Kho rules and the first ever book of Kho-
Kho rules was published from Baroda Gymkhana in 1924.
The year 1936 was the year of the golden opportunity for the
game of Kho-Kho when Berlin Olympic Games featured an
exhibition of Kho-Kho in the main stadium. The Hanuman
Vyayam Prasarak Mandal of Amravati was the proud
demonstrators in that exhibition.
The first ever All India Kho-Kho Championships were
organised at Vijaywada in 1959-60 under the auspices of
Kho-Kho Federation of India. In 1969-70 the junior age group

competitions were organised in Hyderabad. Competitions for

sub-junior girls Veer Bala Award. In 1987, a demonstration
was held in South Asian Games and Asian Kho-Kho
Federation came into existence with three countries as its
members. The Indian Olympic Association had included
Kho-Kho as a discipline in the South Asian Games which
was held at New Delhi in 2013.

Judo
Judo is a popular martial art, combative and
Olympic sport. In the term judo, ‘ju’ means
‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’.
Judo was developed in Japan in the late 19th
century by using the principles of balance and
leverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent
feature is its competitive element, where the
objective is to either throw or putdown one’s
opponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise
subdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver,
or force an opponent to submit by joint locking or
by executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and
thrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense
are a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either
Fig. 7.5: Player playing Judo for participation in competition or self-defense.
History
The history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was
created by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the
techniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the
more dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was
a recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in
1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system.
In the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training
Department, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan
Athletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different
development of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was
being taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando
and special services training often achieved a high standard
of expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo
was given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals
awarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one
silver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had
developed to become an international sport.
There have been two main developments in Judo over the
years. The first was the introduction of weight categories.
Earlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that,
122
if two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man
usually won. Initially there were three categories, and later
this was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic
Games in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform.
There are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the
Olympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style
practice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice
becomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress
on skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them
instinctive and the development of speed through practice
with little resistance.

Rules
Officials
There are three officials who preside over a judo match. There
is one referee who walks around inside the contest area and
conducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally
across the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two
judges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant
goes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge
of awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand
gestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees
with a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision
is decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and
Referees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is
usually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties
and it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel
are also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant. 123
Contestants
The two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for
5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant
wears white uniform and the other a blue uniform.
Uniforms
The judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi,
consisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up
of loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around
the waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They
are either blue or white and they are made so a rival should
be able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able
to make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other
blue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around
the waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the
combatant has reached.
Competition area
The entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square
(14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats
commonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual
mats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter
wide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which
is 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in
color, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will
have a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is
the danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that
they are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the
danger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide
and it is the out-of-bounds area.

In the middle of the contest area are two pieces of tape,
one blue and one white 13.1 feet apart (4-meters). These two
pieces of tape mark the place where the judoka will stand
when they begin and end each bout.

lose to a pool winner are then entered into a repechage round
which is also a single-elimination tournament. The winners of
the repechage pools will be the winners of the bronze medals.
To win the contest a Judoka must score an Ippon a score
that equals 10 points by using successful Judo techniques.
If neither of the Judokas is able to score an Ippon or 10
points by the end of the match, the winner will be the Judoka
who has scored the most points. In the event of a tie, for the
first time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the “Golden Score”
rule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute
period has ended, the referee announces the beginning of
“Golden Score”. This will extend the match for an extra five-
minute period and the contestant who scores the first point
is declared the winner of the match.
Judo penalties
Two types of penalties may be awarded. One is shido and
another is hansoku. After two shido are given, the third
shido becomes hansoku-make and the victory is given to the
opponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make and does not
result in expulsion from the tournament.
Wrestling
124 Considered as one of the most ancient and oldest sport in the
world, wrestling has also been equally popular in India. It is
a form of combat sport involving grappling type techniques
such as clinch, fighting, throws, take downs, joint locks
and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical
competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors
or partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior
position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules,
such as, traditional, historic and modern styles. Wrestling
techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as
well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.

Duryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana
also mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described
as one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India
continued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even
during the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging
support, as the British rulers included the game into the
military practice. In fact, India was considered among the
top 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted
the World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967.
The term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a
local form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti
is composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and
paintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may
be similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi
pat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves
known as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But
what is significantly different about wrestling in India is
that wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts
that last for half an hour or more. At other times and under
other circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined
international guidelines, rules, and regulations.

Scoring rules and terms
• Takedown occurs when a man takes opponent to the
mat from a standing position. This is worth one point,
but can be worth more if the opponent is brought down
onto his back.
• Exposure is turning an opponent’s shoulders to the
mat. Once the line of the back area breaks a 90-degree
angle, points are scored. This can occur both from the
feet and on the mat. A wrestler who holds his opponent
in a danger position for five seconds will receive one
128 extra point.
• Reversal is, when the man underneath completely re-
verses his position and comes to the top position in
control, he has scored a reversal, worth one point.
• Escape is when an athlete works to come out from the
bottom position (after being under dominant control)
and gets to their feet, facing the rival. The athlete has
then scored an escape, worth one point.
• Duration of the bout U-15 cadets and veterans — The
duration of a bout will be of two periods of 02 minutes
with a 30 second break.
