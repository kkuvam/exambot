Adolescents in different situations experience a wide range
of emotions that could vary from positive to negative, such
as, happiness, satisfaction, sadness, anger, frustration, etc.
They have high expectations from themselves that may be
further reinforced by people and environment around them.
This may cause stress in them. There are many occasions
when they may get stressed or feel angry or frustrated.
It is natural for adolescents to experience both positive
and negative emotions. It is also necessary to express their
feelings and emotions. There are positive and negative ways
of expressing the emotions. It is pointed out that negative
emotions and their expression in negative ways may be
caused by certain stresses experienced by the adolescents.
In today’s life, stress is becoming a major cause of many
health-related problems. It is a known fact that chronic stress
negatively affects health. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
cardiac problems, depression, anxiety attacks, road-rage,
etc., have become common now-a-days. The most common
emotion faced by all of us during this COVID-19 pandemic
is fear. It has also made us panicky and anxious to deal with
such issues. Yoga can help us in dealing with stress and
mental health issue during this time. In the management of
stress, lifestyle plays an important role. A healthy lifestyle
reduces stress and promotes one’s health.
Here, it is important to recognise that stress can be
tackled and definitely decreased. Many times, we may not
necessarily be in control of the situations but we can control
our over-all response to such situations.
What is stress?
Stress can be understood as a state of physiological and
psychological imbalance resulting from demanding or
difficult situations which the person is not able to cope with.

In day-to-day life, a person faces many situations.
Some situations are easy to handle; while some are difficult.
As a result, the body starts responding at physiological and
psychological levels. At the physiological level, there may be
changes in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions
of hormones, etc. At the psychological level, there may be
changes in attention, concentration, memory and alertness
and also in the emotional state (like anger, fear, hate,
sadness, etc.).
Stress generally occurs as a result of major events in
life, such as, tough competitions, getting low scores in an
examination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good
job, a fight with others, and so on. There are several other
factors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases,

not affect another student.
Stress which motivates us to perform better and learn new
skills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new
course, preparing for an examination or getting promotion
may cause stress but this stress is beneficial as it finally
contributes towards growth and development. Stress may be
harmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces
efficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect
our ability to feel, think and act.
During severe stress, people may become restless and

worried. They may not remember the things properly. Even
small things may make them angry. You also might have
observed that when you are in tension you become restless.
You may not be able to focus on your studies and small
things may cause irritation.
Chronic and severe stress reduces our body’s ability
to fight diseases. It can lead to various psychosomatic
diseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes
mellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in
heart attack, brain stroke and death. Several psychological
disorders, such as, anxiety attacks and depression may

also result from chronic and severe stress. However, the
fact is — we cannot avoid stress. Therefore, management
of stress is necessary
Yoga as a WaY of Life for stress
ManageMent
Yoga has been considered a panacea for managing the stress.
In this context, we will discuss the role of yoga in developing
a healthy lifestyle by which stress can be managed. Yoga
practices when become a way of life, play an important role
in stress management.
You have learnt about asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra,
bandha and meditation in Class IX. However, yoga is not
limited to the physical postures, breathing techniques or
meditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of
life also. It propounds several principles and practices, such
135
as, asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation
which are relevant to healthy living. Yogic principles and
practices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective
of age, gender, profession or place. As a way of life, yoga gives
direction about food, eating habits, thinking, recreational
means and conduct. Yogic way of life, if adopted in true
sense, empowers us to deal with stress and promote physical
and mental health.
The components of yogic way of life are —
• Ahara (Food)
• Vihara (Relaxation)
• Achara (Conduct)
• Vichara (Thinking)
• Vyavahara (Behaviour or actions)
Ahara
The principles of ahara are related to food consumption.
Yoga emphasises on mitahara, which is related to quality
and quantity of food and also the state of mind during the
intake of food.
As for the quality, the concept of mitahara implies that
food should be freshly cooked, nutritious, nourishing and
in the natural form. Regarding quantity of food, mitahara
mentions that two quarters of the stomach should be
filled with food, one quarter with liquid and the remaining
quarter (one‑fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air.
This implies that quantity of food may vary from person to
person depending upon the individual requirements. It is
very natural that a sportsperson will require more food as
compared to a person who is doing desk job. Mitahara also
advocates that the food should be eaten with positive state of

mind with utmost concentration. You might have observed
if someone eats while watching the television or in an angry
mood or when the person’s attention is somewhere else, then
they tend to just gulp down the food without enjoying it. So,
the state of mind is also very important while eating. Thus,
mitahara emphasises that right quality and quantity of food
should be eaten in a positive state of mind.
Activity 8.2
In Column I, put a list of food items that you like eating and in Column II put the food items
that you consider good for your health.
Column I Column II
Food items that you like eating Food items that you consider good for health
Questions
• Compare the items of both the columns. Do the items in Column I tally with those in
Column II?
• Do you think that you need to change your food habits? Make a separate list indicating
which food items from the list (Column I) you want to change.
Vihara
Vihara means relaxation, which can be brought about
by activities, such as, exercise, recreational and creative
activities like drawing, painting, singing, etc. These activities
help to regulate and channelise our emotions and bring us
joy and happiness. Yogic practices of asana, pranayama and
meditation relax body and mind. In addition to this, relaxation
can be attained in good company also. Sound sleep is also
important for relaxation. It is, therefore, important that we
should regularly follow a timetable that provides adequate
time for yogic and creative activities which are relaxing.

creative activities, exercise and sufficient time for sleep.

Achara
Achara means conduct that includes emotions, attitudes,
desires, instincts and habits. Right conduct is essential for
a stress-free life. Positive emotions and positive attitudes,
good habits and control on desires help in making us strong,
both, individually and socially. The right conduct protects us
from unnecessary stress caused by negative emotions and
attitudes like hate, jealousy, fear, etc.
Therefore, we should have control on our desires, instincts,
emotions, habits and attitudes. Here, yoga is important as
it encourages good conduct in our personal and social life.
Yoga advocates for positive emotions and positive attitude
towards self and other persons. Activity 8.4

Yoganidra
Yoganidra means ‘sleep’ with awareness. Yoganidra is a
state of mind between wakefulness and dream. Normally, we
sleep without awareness. But in yoganidra we sleep with
awareness. Yoganidra is helpful in management of stress. It
relaxes body and mind and reduces tension.
Yoganidra is practised in Shavasana. It consists of body
and breath awareness. The awareness is rotated in quick
succession through all parts of the body, then it is taken to
the breath and finally to the mind.
Fig. 8.22: Shavasana
Let us practise Yoganidra by following the steps given below.
Lie supine in Shavasana. Take deep breath and feel
completely relaxed.

Phase 2: Awareness of the breath
• Now focus your attention on breath. Feel the flow
of your natural breath. Do not change it. Feel the
movement of nostrils with each breath. Now focus
your attention on the movements of the abdominal
area during breathing. Abdomen falls and rises with
each exhalation and inhalation. Continue focussing
your attention on breathing and the movement of the
abdomen. 157
Phase 3: Coming back
• To come back, become aware of your body and be aware
of the time and place you are in. Move your fingers and
toes; and move the head from one side to the other.
Take your own time. Be wide awake. Slowly sit up and
open your eyes.
Note: After breath awareness a scene may be described and
the practitioner is asked to visualise it in that state. Alternately,
different things like floating in a swimming pool, sitting in a garden,
burning a candle, chirping birds, mountains, flowers, rising sun,
a song, etc., can be suggested and the practitioner is asked to
develop vision on thinking, feeling and at an emotional level.
After this, a resolution also can be made. For making a resolution,
before the stage of body awareness, they are asked to think about
what they want to pursue. Now the resolution is repeated three
times. After this, the person is asked to come back by following the
steps as mentioned in the ‘come back’ phase.
