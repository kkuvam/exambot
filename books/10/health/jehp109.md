Food is a basic human need. It is consumed to provide
nourishment to the body. To achieve optimal level of fitness
certain dietary considerations are required. Mostly food is
consumed for its taste or appearance; however, both nutritive
value and quality of food need attention. Food quality, food
adulteration, food spoilage and impact of indiscriminate
use of pesticide and radiation on human health have been
discussed in this lesson.

Factors aFFecting the Planning
Everybody needs a balanced diet irrespective of age but certain
factors influence the food choices. Consider the following
factors while planning meal for good health and fitness.
Age
Body’s need for food and nutrients varies greatly with age.

food and nutrients with growing age. Adolescents grow at a
fast pace and are active, so they need extra nourishment.
But their food preferences are often influenced by friends
and media rather than nutritional requirement. They need
guidance in this regard. Nutritious food preparations can
be planned in the form they enjoy, like spinach paratha or
spinach, carrot and potato soup instead of spinach vegetable.
Elders often have difficulty in chewing, swallowing and
digestion; they need soft and easily digestible foods, such as,
well cooked vegetables, idli etc.
Gender
Nutritional requirements vary with gender. Till the age of 10
years nutritional requirements are same, thereafter both grow
at different pace and their body composition is also different.
Mostly men are taller and heavier than women. They are more
muscular while women have more fat cells. Thus, their body
types are different leading to different nutrient requirements.
Females need more iron (hemoglobin) due to blood loss during
menstruation. Lack of iron often puts them at high risk of
iron deficiency or anemia. Whole grains, seasonal fruits,
green leafy vegetables and dairy products are healthy for both
genders. Food preferences may also vary with gender.
Physical activity
Energy and nutrient requirements vary with physical
activity. Sitting jobs like reading, computer work, etc., need
less energy and heavy duty tasks like cycling, carrying heavy
load, sports, etc., need more energy. Intensity and duration
of activity also affect the requirements, e.g., a person cycling
normally needs lesser energy than a person participating in
a race, need nutrients, like vitamin B, in accordance with
energy requirement. In general energy from fried foods, extra
butter or ghee needs to be avoided. Food preparations from
whole foods, nuts, oilseeds, dairy foods, egg, and fish can
fulfill the requirement for energy and other nutrients.
Physiological state
166
Physiological conditions like infancy, childhood, adolescence,
pregnancy, lactation impose high demands of food and
nutrients due to higher rate of growth and development.
For example, a healthy sedentary woman needs
1900 kcal/day while the same woman, if pregnant, will need
2200 kcal. Similarly an adult man needs 0.8 g protein/Kg
body weight/day. The same person if an athlete requires
2.0g protein/Kg body weight/day. Foods like laddoo (rich
in calories) are quite suitable for highly active and growing
persons while those with sedentary life style should avoid
them to prevent becoming overweight. Careful selection is

helpful to prevent malnutrition and illnesses. Physiological
state also affects the food preferences.
Economic considerations
Some foods are expensive while others are cheap but both
may provide similar nutritional benefits, e.g., cashew nuts are
expensive, groundnuts are cheap and both are good sources
of fat, protein, vitamins and minerals. Seasonal, local, fresh
foods are cheaper and more nutritious. The cost of a food
item also varies from one place to another. Purchasing from
whole sale markets, haats, etc., is economical. Homemade
food is cheaper.
Time and skill
The number and types of dishes served in a meal depend
on the availability of time, ingredients, equipment and skills
of the person who cooks. Lack of these may influence the
167
quality of the meal. Hence, it is necessary to plan in such a
way that nutritional quality is maintained. Preplanning and
time management skills are useful in preparing nutritious
meal in lesser time. All members of the family, including
children, need to be engaged in food preparation activities in
an appropriate manner.
Region, religion and culture
Eating habits are often linked with the foods produced in
the localily, e.g., people living in coastal areas eat more fish
or coconut is popular in Kerala. When the same food is
consumed over a period of time it becomes cultural practice.
Religion also influences the food habits e.g., the Jain
community does not eat onion, garlic, eggs, fish, meat, etc.,
However, mobility, technology and various modern factors
are lessening such impacts. Certain foods are associated
with festivals like, gujia in Holi.
Food preferences of individuals
Food preferences vary from person to person and strongly
affect planning of meals, e.g., a vegetarian cannot eat meat and
a non-vegetarian will not get satisfaction with only vegetarian
dishes. People from south India will get satisfaction with idli
sambhar instead of dal roti. Occasional change is accepted
but dissatisfaction resulted from less preferred food over a
long period of time may lead to under-eating, malnutrition
and health problems.
Sensory appeal
How food satisfies the sensory organs, e.g., tongue, nose,
eyes, ear, constitute sensory appeal. Good looking and
aromatic food appeals and attracts everybody. Appearance,

taste, flavor, texture, temperature, also play a crucial role
in food acceptance. For example, papad has to be crisp and
bread soft; ice cream chilled and soup hot. This has to be
given due consideration.
Related concepts
Taste is a sensation perceived in the mouth and throat. There are four
tastes, i.e., sweet, salt, bitter, sour. The fifth taste is referred to as
umami which is similar to the taste of monosodium glutamate (MSG).
Ayurveda describes six tastes namely, sweet, salt, bitter,
sour, pungent and astringent which can easily be linked with the
tastes of sugar, salt, neem, lemon, chilli and amla respectively.
Flavour is sensed by both nose and tongue together. It
includes both aroma and taste. Lemon has lemony flavor and

exhibit their best performance and maintain endurance.
They are constantly indulged in intense physical exercises,
training, matches and competitions and other sports-related
activities. Hence their energy and nutritional requirements
are also very high. Besides age, gender, body composition,
types of sports, intensity and duration of the event, the
environmental factors also greatly affect their nutritional
requirements. Adequate nutrition is of utmost importance for
their health, physical fitness, endurance, peak performance
and prevention of dehydration, injury and infection. The
right kind of food given at the right time in right proportion
is of paramount importance for sportpersons to prolong their
sporting life.
Carbohydrates

discomfort, muscle stiffness, diarrhea, lethargy, etc., and
eventually hamper the performance.
Protein
Depending upon the intensity of the sport, protein requirement
can range from 1.2 -2.0g per kg body weight per day. Sufficient
intake of carbohydrates ensures that protein is used for
building and repairing of muscles and tissues; for formation
of hormones, enzymes, antibodies and neurotransmitters;
preventing damage; and not for giving energy. For better
utilisation of protein, consume carbohydrate and protein
food sources in appropriate proportion, preferably 3:1 or 4:1
for better performance in endurance events.
Foods like egg, whey protein, soy and milk (casein),
low fat dairy products, grains, nuts, seeds and beans
provide good quality protein. Readymade protein powders
should be avoided or taken under expert supervision only.

lethargy, muscle weakness, injuries and infection. At the
same time high protein intake particularly from animal foods
or protein powders or supplements may cause unnecessary
weight gain, calcium excretion in urine and adverse effect
on bones, liver and kidney functions. Consumption of more
protein is advisable after the event, during rest period for
repair and recovery of the body.
Fat
Fat is not considered a good source of energy during exercise
and competition. It is metabolised very slowly, thus, is
better for slow and long duration events like marathon.
Fats like butter, cream, cow’s ghee or coconut oil are good
for synthesis of hormone necessary to maintain stamina in
sport. Nuts, seeds, low fat dairy products are good choices
as they also provide other nutrients and antioxidants. Foods
rich in omega-3 fatty acids like flax seeds, fish oil, salmon,
consumed in the right amount, enhance strength and vigour
in the body and accelerate performance. However, high intake
of fat eventually leads to overweight, obesity and associated
health problems which hamper performance significantly.
Vitamins and minerals
Vitamins and minerals are crucial in sport because energy
utilisation in the body is largely associated with them,
particularly some group B vitamins and magnesium. Folate,
calcium, zinc, iron are other crucial micronutrients which
get depleted faster during long exercises. Vitamin C plays
an important role in collagen synthesis and absorption and
utilisation of iron in the body. Vitamin B6 helps in protein
utilisation. Vitamin A, E and C are important to prevent cell
damage and act as antioxidants which are needed to reduce
stress and improve stamina and immunity. Adequate intake
of these supports the performance and recovery from injury
in sport. Colorful fruits and vegetables, dairy products,
seeds, nuts and whole grains taken in sufficient amount can
provide the needed vitamins and minerals.
170
Water and fluids
Water and fluids maintain the hydration level and electrolyte
balance in the body and are crucial in sports. Dehydration
can be serious and can lead to heat exhaustion, profuse
sweating, muscle cramps, vertigo (fainting), vomiting,
constipation, excessive fatigue and disturbance in vision
and coordination. It can hamper the performance and reduce
endurance significantly. Drinking 2-2.5 liters of water may be
adequate but up to 5-6 liters a day in hot weather and intense
exercises may be needed. Sometimes just potable water is
not sufficient addition of glucose and salt is also needed.

Cool but not cold water is better absorbed and maintains
the body temperature. Safe drinking water and beverages

levels. Recommendations are available for required amounts

Nutritious food too, if contaminated or adulterated is not
safe for consumption as it may cause infection or disease.
Hence the causes of food spoilage, and the ways to improve
the food quality need to be understood.
Food quality is the criteria by which a person accepts 171

or rejects any food item. It is crucial at every stage of food
handling from farm to table. Good quality food brings
health and well-being and poor quality can cause illness
and rejection of food in the market as well. Quality of food is
often judged in terms of microbiological load and alterations
in physical parameters and chemical composition of food.
Food quality risks include food adulteration. In order to

It is necessary to observe the quality marks, like FSSAI,
AGMARK and ISI, on the food articles while selection to
ensure quality.
When food quality is modified intentionally, it is called
food adulteration. Over ripening or excessive microbial load
causes food spoilage. All these aspects are discussed briefly
in the following section.

treatments can also be given for this, food preservation is
one of them.
Food preservation
Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food
to stop or slow down spoilage and extend shelf life of food.
It works on the principles of reducing the moisture content,
preventing the growth of micro organisms causing spoilage
and controlling enzymatic activity. The techniques are —
1. Heat treatment: Application of heat helps in preserving
food by destroying the harmful microorganisms. For
example, Pasteurisation of milk and sterilisation of
bottles.
2. Refrigeration and freezing: Low temperature limit

5. Preservation by Radiation: Radiations are emissions
of intense energy capable of penetrating tissues. When
food is exposed to specific form of radiation (gamma
rays from Cobalt 60) under controlled conditions it
increases their shelf life and is referred as irradiated
food. Items like fruits, potatoes, onions, spices, herbs
and some ready-to-eat foods can be preserved in this
way. But this technique is not suitable for milk and
milk products. The safety of irradiated foods is under
debate. Consumers can choose or avoid irradiated
foods by identifying its symbol on the label. This mark
has been approved by Food safety and Standards
Regulations Authority of India (2015).

deleting the vital component. It is usually done intentionally
to increase the profits. It makes the food unsafe to eat;
degrades the food quality and is injurious to health.
Under Food Safety Standards Act (2006) adulterated
food is now termed as substandard food, unsafe food or food
containing extraneous matter. The helpline where an individual
can lodge complaint is —
http://nationalconsumerhelpline.in/foodSafety.aspx
The following criteria designate any food as adulterated
or unsafe and the person responsible for any of these is
punishable under law —
1. The article itself, or its package thereof, is composed,
whether wholly or in part, of poisonous or deleterious
substances.
2. The article consists of, wholly or in part, any filthy,
putrid, rotten, decomposed or diseased animal
substance or vegetable substance.
3. The article contains of unhygienic processing or the
presence of any harmful substance in that article.
4. It contains substitution of any inferior or cheaper
substance whether wholly or in part.
5. It contains addition of a substance directly or as an
ingredient which is not permitted.
6. There is abstraction, wholly or in part, of any of its
constituents.
7. The article is colored, flavored or coated, powdered or
polished, so as to damage or conceal the article or to
make it appear better or of greater value than it really
is.
8. There is presence of any coloring matter or
preservatives other than that specified in respect
thereof or in quantity more than prescribed.
9. The article has been infected or infested with worms,
weevils, or insects.
9. The article is prepared, packed or kept under
insanitary conditions.

As a part of its mandate to ensure safe food to the citizens,
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
conducts testing of food for different types of adulterants,
chemical and micro-biological contaminants and other
safety parameters for food. The food testing is done by FSSAI
through a network of FSSAI notified laboratories across
the country. The food safety officers collect samples of food
products for testing. A consumer can also get the samples
of food tested in such labs. If the food is found unsafe after
testing, the cost of the test is reimbursed to the consumer.
Adverse effects of food adulteration on health
176
Adulteration is detrimental to health. Many a times food
is adulterated in such a way that it looks the same but
soon it may change in taste, appearance and nutritional
composition, often leading to harmful effects on health.
Consuming adulterated food can cause the symptoms like
diarrhea, vomiting, headache, abdominal cramps, fatigue,
etc. Sometimes its impact may not be instantly visible but
may distort the functioning of the immune, digestive and
nervous system. It can also lead to liver disorder, heart
disease, paralysis, brain damage, cancer, etc. Consumption

of adulterated food by pregnant women may lead to abortion
or damage the brain of the baby. Children, pregnant and
lactating women, elderly people, weak and sick persons are
at higher risk of consequences of food adulteration.
Actions to be taken against food adulteration
1. Buy food products having standard mark like FSSAI,
AGMARK, etc.
2. If you suspect adulteration in any food, do not buy or
consume it.
3. Make others aware of suspected adulteration by
various modes — personal, print media and digital
media
