# AI-Based Chatbot for Exam Preparation

## Project Overview

This project involves building an AI-based chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) designed to assist students in preparing for their school exams. The chatbot interacts using natural language and provides help with subjects such as English, Science, and Social Studies. Its main functionalities include explaining concepts, answering syllabus-related questions, and generating practice questions to support self-study. The goal is to create an accessible, responsive, and intelligent study companion that replicates the experience of having a personal tutor.
